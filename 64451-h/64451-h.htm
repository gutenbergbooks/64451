<p><i>I have the honor to transmit herewith the Palæontological Report
of the College Scientific Expedition of 1877.</i></p>

<p><i>The fossils collected by the Palæontological party, and deposited by the
chief of the expedition in the Geological Museum, consisted of two sets, one
numbering some two thousand specimens of fossil plants and insects from
the tertiary beds of Central Colorado, the other of a considerable series of
fossil vertebrates, mostly mammals, from the tertiary beds of Wyoming
Territory, around Fort Bridger. This last collection has been studied and
worked out with unabated zeal and diligence by the three post-graduate
members of the Palæontological party, Messrs. H. Osborn, W. Scott, and
F. Speir, who devoted most of the time of their course to this special work,
with what success this Report will show.</i></p>

<p><i>It will be a source of gratification to the generous friends of the College,
who furnished means for the Scientific Expedition of 1877, that it not
only enriched our Museum to so great an extent, but did more still by
fostering in our College a thorough study of Palæontology, which could
not have been undertaken without such means as these thus placed at the
disposal of our students.</i></p>

<p><i>The fossil insects and plants have been intrusted to the hands of the
best specialists for determination. Dr. S. Scudder, of Cambridge, Mass.,
has kindly consented to revise the insects. Prof. G. L. Lequereux the plants.</i></p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir:</span> We transmit herewith our report upon the Palæontological collections
made by the Princeton party in the summer of 1877.</p>

<p>The following persons constituted the Palæontological division: <span class="smcap">Rollin H.
Lynde, Henry F. Osborn, Jotham Potter, Wm. B. Scott, Francis Speir</span>, Jr.
The division remained in Colorado from the first of July until the first of
August, when, under the direction of Professor Kargè, it left the main party,
and passed the month of August in Wyoming, returning in the first part of
September. The Colorado collections were mostly made in the (probable)
Miocene beds near Florissant, and in the beds near the Garden of the Gods,
variously referred to the <i>Dakota</i> and <i>Wealden</i> groups. In Wyoming, with
Fort Bridger as a base of explorations, the division was wholly occupied in
the Bridger series, camping successively on Smith's Fork, Henry's Fork, and
Dry Creek, and exploring the beds adjacent.</p>

<p>It has been our endeavor, in confining our attention to the remains of
vertebrated animals collected during the trip, not merely to catalogue the direct
results, but, by the aid of fresh materials, to supplement the work of others.
For, of the descriptions and data of the Bridger Eocene Fauna published up
to the present time, we find that even those which have been most accurately
prepared are lacking in important details; and that, owing to imperfect materials,
large gaps yet remain in our knowledge of genera and species named
and classed years ago. Although such supplementary work may appear, at first
sight, tedious and ill-directed, we are confident that in the end it will prove of
some value to science, and that it is therefore well worthy of our effort. While
our field work did not extend beyond a region previously well explored, we
obtained material by means of which we are able to add a number of new
fossils to the Eocene Fauna of the Bridger group.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this report we have experienced much difficulty in
assigning some of our specimens to their proper genera and species. For,
while we have desired to respect the classifications made by others, we have
in many cases found it impossible to do so, owing to uncharacteristic definition,
which, without doubt, has been unavoidable. In all cases of uncertainty, we
have adopted the classification which appeared to be the best established.
This, in short, has proved the only available course.</p>

<p>The drawings have been executed with much care as to accuracy of proportion
and outline. They are, with one exception, the work of a member of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[ 8 ]</a></span>
the party; and they are inserted simply to illustrate certain parts of the context,
which would be unsatisfactory without reference to figures of the kind.</p>

<p>Now that the present work is ready for the press, we are very sensible that
it must contain errors which, while they have escaped our notice, will be readily
detected by eyes more experienced. These, we trust, will be excused, when
it is remembered that we are just entering a field which others have explored
for years; and opening a work which Princeton, with her many other lines
of study, has never hitherto attempted.</p>

<p>We lake this opportunity to return our most hearty thanks to General
Flint, to Judge and Dr. Carter, to Mr. Hamilton, and other officers and
residents at Fort Bridger, who, by their good will and liberal assistance,
contributed largely to our success. Our gratitude is also due to Professors Leidy
and Cope for their generous aid, both in the way of advice and of material
put in our hands for comparison.</p>

<p>The following pages do not embrace descriptions of the entire collections
made by the Princeton party last summer. The valuable specimens of fossil
plants and insects have passed into other hands.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fort Bridger</span> is a government military post, situated on the high southern
plateau of western Wyoming Territory, in the midst of one of the most interesting
geological regions of the world.</p>

<p>The country on all sides was once the bottom of a great eocene lake, the
water of which was probably slightly brackish. Whether this lake district had
direct communication with the ocean, is undetermined as yet, but there is a possibility
that it had.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

4, p. 819.</p></div>

<p>The tributaries of the Green River, which drain this plateau, render the valleys
along the edges of the streams green and wooded. Beyond this fertile
strip, wide, barren plains extend, covered by a dense growth of short "sage
brush" (Artemisia tridentata).</p>

<p>From the fragmentary debris lying scattered over the surface of the ground,
it would seem as if the various streams formerly were of much greater size and
volume than they now are, and that long after the eocene lakes had been drained-rivers
of considerable size ploughed up the lake bottoms, excavating an immense
area. The formation known as "Mauvaises Terres" rises abruptly from the
valleys, and extends in a series of plateaus, one above the other, on either side.</p>

<p>The high land shows the effect of violent erosion in two forms; first, the irregular
and jagged cones that appear upon the sides of the high benches; and,
second, the isolated butte structure, rising directly out of the plain.</p>

<p>The bad lands of Cottonwood Creek, Henry's Fork, Dry Creek, etc., are examples
of the first, and Bridger Butte the best known example of the second.</p>

<p>Bridger Butte, six miles to the south-west of Fort Bridger, rises to a height
of over a hundred feet, and is about two miles long; its sides slope steeply up,
and its level top serves as a landmark that can be seen miles away.</p>

<p>The stratification throughout this whole formation is nearly horizontal, and
across the valley can be distinctly noted, owing to the color and appearance of
the various layers.</p>

<p>No satisfactory explanation has been given of the causes which occasioned
the removal of the waters of these lakes, nor of the agencies necessary to accomplish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[ 10 ]</a></span>
the great excavations that now show the former bottoms of the basins.
These and like points future investigation will undoubtedly solve.</p>

<p>It is certain that the level of the lakes varied at different times, and also
that great stretches of marshy land surrounded their borders.</p>

<p>The first fact is proved by the characters of the different layers of strata; the
second by the fossil remains entombed. A careful study of the formation of
the beds of Cottonwood Creek, at a point about fourteen miles south of Fort
Bridger, yielded the following result, which will serve as an example illustrative
of the regular formation in this section.</p>

<p>Three distinct lines of bluffs are to be noticed, the first rising to a height of
one hundred and fifty feet; from these extends a plain, gently sloping south-west
to the foot of the second line of cliffs; these seem high, owing to the downward
slope of the plain, but they really rise only fifty feet higher than the first.</p>

<p>On the top of the second, but less broad than the first, extends a level plain,
with a slight dip to the south-east; at the end of this, the third line rises two
hundred feet above the top of the second line of bluffs, making a total height,
in the series, of four hundred feet above the level of Smith's Fork.</p>

<p>The strata throughout are nearly horizontal, and are of different color and
composition.</p>

<p>Specimens of the rocks and clays from this section were gathered, and submitted
for analysis to Professor Cornwall, of the Scientific School at Princeton,
who has kindly furnished us with the following notes:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No. 1, very friable, light greenish-gray sedimentary rocks, consisting chiefly
of crystalline grains of quartz, orthoclase, and hornblende (this often in slender
crystals), with a little dark mica, and irregular fragments of a light-greenish,
transparent, not dichroitic mineral. The above are not perceptibly affected by
hot hydrochloric acid. The whole is loosely cemented with a calcareous clay,
containing considerable phosphoric acid. These rocks might result from the
disintegration of a neighboring hornblendic granite.</p>

<p>The greatest mass of the strata is made up of this kind of rock, and it is
this which gives the peculiar color to the "Mauvaises Terres."</p>

<p>Above this in places is found a second kind, which is a light gray indurated
clay, with a slight greenish tint. It contains much fine crystalline quartz, with
considerable carbonate of lime, and a little phosphoric acid.</p>

<p>It appears to be of similar origin with the first, but was deposited in quieter
waters. This mineralogical evidence is strengthened by the fact that no remains
of mammals were found in strata of this kind, but only shells regularly
deposited in layers one above another.</p>

<p>The third kind is found in thin layers, overtopping the highest line of buttes;
it consists of very fine-grained dark-brown sandstones, containing a considerable
proportion of carbonate and phosphate of lime. They are hard and
tough, and are mechanically deposited, and no fossils are found in them.</p>

<p>In No. 2 the indurated clay is often found above a coarser sandstone than
No. 1, but of the same general appearance; with the exception that it contains
smooth, rounded pebbles, which were deposited either on a beach or in running
water. In this stratum the fossils found are separate bones, often showing
marks of having been broken before they were silicified. This would prove
that the lake level was changing continually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[ 11 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Several skeletons of animals have been found in a standing position, with
their legs slightly stretched out. They were probably mired, and, being unable
to extricate themselves, died in an erect position. This fact affords evidence
that extensive swamps surrounded the borders of the lake.</p>

<p>The snow-water and the spring rains wear deep gulleys through the lines of
cliffs, and wash down fragments of bones into the dried-up water-courses.
These pieces can generally be traced up to the spot from which they came, and
the rest of the skeleton can so be secured.</p>

<p>The fossils found in the eocene of Wyoming are entirely petrified, presenting
a darker appearance than their matrix; but loose bones washed out, and subjected
to the influence of the sun and rain, often become bleached so as to resemble
in color modern bones.</p>

<p>The state of preservation of the fossils differs according to the matrix in
which they are found. Generally speaking, the remains found in the lower
lines of buttes have been considerably distorted by pressure; while those from
the highest line have suffered very little from this cause.</p>

consists of a cone with posterior heel. Fourth premolar
exhibits, besides its principal cone, an interior lateral one
and a large heel. The true molars support two anterior
tubercles, of which the inner is represented by two distinct
cusps in one or more of them, and the external is crescentoid
in section. The posterior part of the crown is wide and concave,
and bordered at its posterior angles by an obsolete
tubercle on the inner, and an elevated angle on the outer
side." (Palæontology, Wheeler's Survey, iv (pt. 2), p. 135.)</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Tomitherium rostratum</span>, Cope.</p>

<p class="tdc">Loc. cit., p. 548.</p>

<p>This species exhibits considerable variation, both in size
and proportion of the teeth. We have two specimens of it,
one of which agrees exactly with the measurements given
by Professor Cope, while the other is stouter, and probably
belonged to an old male.</p>

<p>The incisors are too much broken for description. The
canine has a long, stout fang, which is subcircular in section;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[ 14 ]</a></span>
the crown is compressed, and shows a distinct cutting edge
posteriorly. It is short, and tapers rapidly; in this respect
differing from <i>Notharctus</i>, Leidy, which has a long recurved
canine. The first and second premolars are inserted each by
a single fang; the third and fourth by two. The third premolar
consists of a simple conical crown with a small posterior
heel; and the fourth has this heel enlarged, with a small
tubercle developed inside and slightly behind the principal
lobe. All the premolars have striated enamel, and very feebly
marked basal ridges.</p>

<p>The true molars are considerably larger than the premolars;
the third is the longest of the series, and the second
is the widest. They all seem to be inserted by two fangs.
The posterior fang of the last molar is a flat quadrate, of the
same size throughout, having a great fore-and-aft diameter,
and apparently no nerve cavity. The mandible is strong but
shallow, has a curved alveolus and lower margin, and the
teeth form a curve with convexity outwards. The symphysis
is short and oblique.</p>

<p>This genus presents a close resemblance to the modern
<i>Lemur</i>, but at the same time shows several differences. We
may give these differences in systematic order: (1) Greater
number of premolars, in <i>Tomitherium</i> = 4, in <i>Lemur</i> = 2. It
will be observed, however, that the first and second premolars
of <i>Tomitherium</i> are very small and single-rooted, and that
their disappearance is a comparatively slight change. (2) The
canines are subcircular in section, not nearly so much compressed.
(3) Greater breadth of the molars in proportion to
their length. (4) Two internal cusps on the molar. (5) Much
greater size of the last molar. (6) Greater depth and thickness
of the jaw. (7) Greater curvature of alveolus and
lower margin of ramus. (8) Longer and more oblique symphysis.</p>

<p>The third and fourth premolars of <i>Tomitherium</i> correspond
almost exactly to the first and second of <i>Lemur</i>, but they are
not quite so high and sharp. The interior tubercle of the
second premolar is not so distinct in the latter genus.</p>

<p>In the second specimen the cusps are all low, and the
crests prominent, giving the molars something of the appearance
of <i>Opisthotomus</i>. This difference is probably sexual.</p>

<p>This is one of the most common fossils found in the
Bridger Basin. We have numerous specimens, chiefly from
Henry's Fork, exhibiting a large range of individual and
sexual variation. As Dr. Leidy has already pointed out, the
strength and depth of the lower jaw is extremely variable, increasing
with the age of the animal; so that the most worn
teeth are associated with the deepest jaws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[ 16 ]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to the jaws and teeth, (which have been very
accurately described), we have a portion of a pelvis and femur,
which are important as tending to confirm the reference of
this genus to the Lemurs.</p>

<p>The <i>pelvis</i> is represented by the acetabulum and a small
portion of ilium and ischium. They resemble the corresponding
parts in the skeleton of <i>Stenops gracilis</i>. The acetabulum
is a long oval, not subcircular, deep, and quite narrow
from side to side. It appears to be directed nearly straight
outwards. The ilium is narrow, has a concave gluteal surface,
and a prominent acetabular border. The pubis evidently
projected forward, making a right angle with the ilium; while
the ischium is slender and nearly in the same plane with the
ilium. The femur is thoroughly lemurine in shape. The shaft,
(as much of it as is preserved), is straight and sub-cylindrical;
it is not flattened even distally, but becomes very thick and trihedral
in shape just above the trochlea. The trochlea is long,
and rises obliquely upon the shaft; the groove is deep, and the
two divisions are asymmetrical, the external somewhat the
larger. The condyles are large. They are but slightly convex
in either direction and project backwards, and are broadest
posteriorly. The internal is the larger. They are separated
by a deep but not wide popliteal groove, which does
not extend into a popliteal fossa. The position and shape of
the condyles are such as show that the femur must have been
very oblique to the tibia, as in the other lemurs. The tuberosities,
especially the internal, are very large and prominent.
The whole distal end has an asymmetrical appearance, owing
to the greater size of the internal condyle.</p>

<h2><a name="CARNIVORA" id="CARNIVORA">CARNIVORA</a></h2>


<p class="caption3nb">SINOPA, Leidy.</p>

<p>A genus of small carnivorous animals, which Dr. Leidy
regards as intermediate between the recent <i>Canis</i> and the extinct
<i>Hyænodon</i>. Owing to the fragmentary condition of the
remains found, no satisfactory generic definition has been
given.</p>

<p>From the portion in our collection, we are able to throw
some further light upon the genus, summing up the generic
characteristics thus: Small carnivores, which have the last
upper premolar as sectorial (thus differing from <i>Hyænodon</i>),
the other premolars simple and conical.</p>

<p>The sectorial is shorter, antero-posteriorly, than the preceding
tooth; has a short blade of a single lobe, and a large
cusp developed from the posterior part; a cingulum surrounds
the entire crown. The <i>lower</i> sectorial has the blade
of a single lobe, and with a short heel.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Sinopa rapax</span>, Leidy.</p>

<p class="tdc">Proceedings of Ac. Nat. Sc., 1871, p. 115.</p>

<p>In addition to the molars of the lower jaw, described by
Dr. Leidy we have what corresponds to the third and fourth
premolars of the fox, their dental formulas being probably the
same.</p>

<p>The third premolar is small and pointed; differing from the
corresponding tooth in the fox, (1) in its being less compressed,
(2) in its shorter antero-posterior diameter, (3) in
the straighter and more nearly equal margins, and in (4) the
absence of a posterior heel.</p>

<p>The tooth is inserted by two fangs, as in <i>Canis</i> and <i>Hyænodon</i>.
The posterior shows a rudiment of a third, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[ 19 ]</a></span>
connate with its entire length above the alveolus. There is
an indistinct cingulum around the entire crown.</p>

<p>The fourth premolar has a very curious shape. The blade
of this tooth resembles the crown of the third, but is smaller.
It is inserted by three fangs, the disposition of which is opposite
to that in <i>Canis</i>, the internal, being on the same transverse
line as the posterior external, instead of the anterior, as in
<i>Canis</i>. From the internal fang arises a sharp cusp, which is
nearly as large as the blade of the tooth, the two are connate
at base. The anterior face of the crown is much worn, and
there is a small anterior heel formed by the basal ridge. The
cingulum is complete all around.</p>

<p>The <i>maxillary</i> does not show the outward bulge at the
third premolar, which is so marked in the fox. The alveolus
is straighter, and the palatine plates are comparatively thicker
and flatter. The infraorbital foramen is oval, and not so
much compressed as in the fox, to which it corresponds very
nearly in position, though situated slightly forward as in <i>Hyænodon</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sacrum</i> (<a href="#Plate_9">Plate IX.</a>, Fig. 8).&mdash;This peculiar sacrum is composed
of only one true vertebra; there may have been one or
more pseudo-sacrals, but this is not certain.</p>

<p>The centrum is very long, strongly depressed, and straight
on the inner margin, not curved as in the sacrum of most
mammals. The anterior articular face is much depressed, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[ 20 ]</a></span>
is one third larger than the posterior. The neural canal is
low and subtriangular, resembling very much that of <i>Canis</i>.
The pleuropophysial plates for articulation with the ilia are
large and stout. The laminæ are heavy and concave on their
upper side, supporting a very long, stout spine, which is retroverted
and decidedly tuberous at the end.</p>

<p>The pedicles are deeply notched behind; and on the fore
part, just inside the metapophyses, there is a deep fossa.</p>

<p>The chief features of this sacrum are decidedly carnivorous;
but to what genus or family it should be referred we
are unable to say.</p>

<p>It has some of the characteristics of <i>Canis</i>, but the length
and retroversion of the spine, as well as the size of the centrum,
prevent this classification. In the general form of the pleuropophysial
plates it approximates to the <i>seals</i>; while in its angle
and curvature, it partakes of the character of the <i>Ursidæ</i>.</p>

<p>The chief point of interest in this fossil centres in the fact
that it was found only a few feet from the brain cast that is

<p>In close proximity to the pelvis of the <i>Uintatherium Leidianum</i>,
in one of the upper beds we found an intracranial
cast, separate from the bone which had enclosed it, and in
such preservation as to warrant a partial determination, at
least, of the type to which it belonged. Wishing to obtain as
full information as the nature of the cast permitted, we put it
in the hands of Dr. Spitzka, of New York, who kindly undertook
an examination, and sent us the following as the result:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[ 21 ]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir:</span> The specimen submitted to me is the intracranial cast of some species
of Placental Mammals. The cranium had been subject to the influences of the
atmosphere, etc., for a considerable period preceding the formation of the cast,
and therefore the cast reflects the sutural dislocations which occurred in consequence.
The base of the brain cast it is not advisable to attempt to expose, on
account of the treacherous nature of the material. The convolutions corresponding
to the internal aspect of the <i>Os temporale</i> have not been clearly demarcated
by the bone surface. The two narrow eminences on it are casts of the
grooves of the middle meningeal arteries. The convolutions of the occipital
surface had been well marked, but somewhat obliterated through denudation,
etc. The important region bordering on each side of the median fissure, and
corresponding to the fronto-parietal suture, is unfortunately as good as destroyed;
and with this destruction the key to the interpretation of the specimen
is lost. However, this much can be stated with absolute certainty, that the
frontal region is sufficiently well preserved to state that its convolutions do not
correspond to those of the brain of the tapir, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, elephant,
pig, horse, hyrax, manatus, or any ruminant or cetacean.</p>

<p>"They also differ in important particulars from those of the <i>Canidæ</i>, differ less
from those of the <i>Felidæ</i>, still less from the <i>Ursidæ</i>, although corresponding to none
of them. The outline of the cerebral cast is found in two living animals&mdash;the
marine otter and the seal. But in the seal the gyri show the transverse interrupting
series of sulci, characteristic of extreme brachycephaly; and it therefore
cannot belong to any animal corresponding to the seal.</p>

<p>"The sea otter's convolutional details are unknown to me, and I believe have
not yet been studied. I therefore content myself with stating that the outline
of this cast corresponds to the outline of the sea otter's cranium.</p>

<p>"It would help us a great deal if we could decide the existence or non-existence
of a bony tentorium. The sutures of this cranium, as far as I can reconstruct
them, ran as in the diagram.</p>

<p>"We may state definitely that this was not an ursine, feline, or canine brain,
nor the brain of any terrestrial viverrine. It is an open question between an
<i>aquatic carnivore</i> and an <i>aquatic pachyderm</i>; and although not placing my conclusion
on an exact basis, yet, in view of the general outline, the course of the
convolutions, and the course of the sutures, I incline to the former view.</p>

<p>"It certainly corresponds to no known brain of a living creature. In one
point I was inclined to suspect it to be a pachyderm, namely, the decided asymmetry
of some of the sulci, but this, by itself, is not decisive."</p>

<p class="tdr">"<span class="smcap">Dr. Spitzka</span>.</p>

<p class="p0">"308 East 123d street."</p>

</div>

<p>The interesting letter quoted in full above, contains as near
a determination of the character of the animal to which the
brain belonged, as the nature of the cast and the materials for
comparison would permit. In a later report, by means of
more complete comparative material, we hope to be able to
reach a more satisfactory conclusion. However, as Dr.
Spitzka writes, the <i>general outline</i>, the <i>course</i> of the <i>convolutions</i>,
and the <i>line</i> of the <i>sutures</i> offer strong presumptive evidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[ 22 ]</a></span>
that the cast belongs to one of the <i>Aquatic carnivores</i>. Not
far from the brain was found a sacrum, which is described
above as belonging to some carnivore, though further determination
was impossible. Whether there was any connection
between the two is difficult to state. The presence
of an aquatic carnivore in the Bridger eocene is new to
science; but, aside from this, the brain is of a much higher
order than previous discoveries would lead us to expect in
such an early formation.</p>

<p>Professor Marsh's researches have led him to form the
opinion that the eocene mammals had brains of a low character;
but this specimen shows that this is not true of all, if it is
of most of them. The convolutions are not only numerous
and well marked, but they are complicated, showing the
transverse as well as the longitudinal folds. To such an extent
is this true that the brain will bear comparison with the
very highest modern carnivorous types.</p>

<p>We hope to be able to give further notes upon this interesting
specimen at a later date.</p>

<p>A small calcaneum and astragalus of equine type are provisionally
referred to this genus until further material enables
us to determine them with certainty.</p>

<p>The <i>astragalus</i> has narrow and very oblique condyles,
which are more equal in size than in <i>Orohippus</i>; the neck is
very short, the internal condyle reaching to the face for the
navicular; the posterior projection of this condyle is much
shorter than in that genus. The articular face for the navicular
is quadrate in shape and concave; the cuboid face is
very narrow. The articulation with the calcaneum is made
by a narrow, convex face. When the two are in position the
navicular face of the astragalus is in the same horizontal line
as the cuboid face of the calcaneum, thus resembling the
arrangement of the horse's tarsus rather than that of <i>Orohippus</i>.</p>

<p>The calcaneum is a short, slender bone, having the upper
and lower margins convergent toward the tuberosity, and
not parallel as in <i>Orohippus</i>. The tuberosity is especially
small. The face for the cuboid is very narrow.</p>

<p>From the articular facets of these two bones we can see
that the tarsus resembled very much that of the modern
horse, with a broad, short navicular, and a narrow cuboid.
The strata in which these remains were found were somewhat
higher than those containing the bones of <i>Orohippus</i>.</p>

hemispherical head, developed on a long and slender neck;
the head is but slightly out of the axis of the shaft, and has a
large pit for ligamentous insertion. The shaft is long, simple,
and curved slightly forward. At the proximal end it is
broad and flattened axially; below this it becomes expanded
fore-and-aft, but it thickens greatly at the distal end, just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[ 25 ]</a></span>
above the condyles. The great trochanter is large and retroverted,
rising above the head, with two prominences rising from
it, one on top, the other back. The digital fossa is wide and
deep, penetrating far into the great trochanter. The second
trochanter is a small rounded ridge; the third trochanter is
large and prominent, curving slightly forward. The condyles
are long and narrow, projecting very far back, and are separated
by a wide and deep popliteal groove. From the external
condyle a low ridge runs obliquely, forming the upper
border of the shallow popliteal space. The trochleæ are long,
very convex, deeply grooved, and symmetrical.</p>

<p>The <i>tibia</i> (<a href="#Plate_9">Plate IX.</a>, Fig. 3) is very long and heavy, with
broad proximal articular face, the inner borders of which are
prolonged upward and separated by a groove.</p>

<p>The shaft at the tuberosity is subtriangular, with strongly
concave sides. The tuberosity is prominent, with a deep pit
on its upper surface for the insertion of the ligament of the
patella. The shaft below becomes sub-cylindrical, and decreases
regularly in size downward. Its curvature is forward.
The distal articular face is divided by a smooth ridge
into two deep facets. The malleolus is long.</p>

<p>The <i>fibula</i> (<a href="#Plate_9">Plate IX.</a>, Fig. 2) is distinct, straight, and very

<p><i>Specific characters.</i>&mdash;Sagittal crest short and thick. Temporal
fossæ not very deep. Frontals diverge rapidly. Occipital
condyles wide and low; the same is true of the foramen
magnum. Meatus auditorius high and deep. Glenoid
cavity shallow; no internal process. As compared with <i>P.
Paludosus</i>, post-glenoid process not so much compressed.
Occipital region comparatively higher and not so concave.
The occipital condyles are more prominent. The zygomas
are lighter. Head larger than <i>Paludosus</i>, perhaps not so large
as <i>Vallidens</i>.</p>

<p>Description from (i) a head, complete, but distorted, with
complete dentition, upper and lower. (2) A head somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[ 28 ]</a></span>
crushed, and lacking some portions, with full set of upper
molars and canines. (3) A great number of fragmentary specimens
of different parts of the body.</p>

<p><i>Dentition.</i>&mdash;In the upper jaw the incisors are arranged in a
semi-circle as in <i>P. paludosus</i>; they have long fangs and short,
conical crowns, with a decided basal ridge, which is very
strong in the third. They increase from first to third, which
is very large and pointed.</p>

<p>The canines have very large and long fangs (longer than
the crowns). The crowns are very stout and pointed, constituting
formidable weapons. In section they are nearly circular,
with a distinct hinder margin and a slight recurve. A
rudimentary anterior margin is sometimes present, and of the
faces thus marked off, the inner is much smaller and flatter.
The general direction is forwards, downwards, and slightly
outwards. There is a diastema of about half an inch between
the incisors and canines.</p>

<p><i>Premolars.</i>&mdash;The first is very small, about half an inch
from the canine, simple and conical, with an obscurely marked
basal ridge, and two heavy fangs.</p>

<p>Further description of the upper dentition is unnecessary,
owing to the complete work of Dr. Leidy upon the subject.</p>

<p>The <i>lower incisors</i> are placed in a semi-circular row, and
are somewhat procumbent, though hardly as much so as in the
tapir. They are much as in <i>P. paludosus</i>, but are relatively
smaller, and have not such distinct basal ridges; features
which indicate a departure from the carnivorous type, and a
nearer approach to the herbivorous type. The lateral incisor,
though the largest of the series, is not so large nor so pointed
as in <i>P. paludosus</i>. There is no diastema.</p>

<p>The <i>canines</i> are about equal in size to those of the upper
jaw, growing from stout fangs and permanent pulps. The
margins of the crowns are more decided, and are smooth,
leaving a very narrow and flat inner face. A feeble basal
ridge. When the jaw was closed, the lower canines passed
inside and in front of the upper.</p>

<p>The <i>first premolar</i> stands immediately behind the canine,
is longer than that of the upper jaw, consisting of a single
pointed lobe implanted by one fang, slightly recurved with a
flat inner and convex outer face. Passing in front of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[ 29 ]</a></span>
first upper premolar, it leaves a considerable diastema between
this and the second premolar.</p>

<p>The <i>mandible</i> approximates in form that of the tapir; the
lower border is less curved fore and aft, the alveolar border
is slightly concave antero-posteriorly. The molars converge
in front, presenting a very different arrangement from that in
<i>Sus</i>. The ramus is heavy, contracting in depth forward, and
very slightly in section. Below the alveolus, on the interior
side, the ramus is greatly swollen for two thirds of its depth,
to accommodate the very long and strong molar fangs.</p>

<p>The rami converge to the second premolar, where they
expand laterally to the canine alveolus. The symphysis is
shorter relatively than in <i>P. paludosus</i>, and the chin is regularly
rounded in front. The mental foramen is below the second
premolar. The dental foramen is small, very high up, and far
behind the molars. The alveolar border ascends rapidly behind
the last molar, expanding laterally into two ridges.</p>

<p>The coronoid is slender and recurved. The condyle is
broad, flat behind, inclines forward internally; there is
scarcely any depression between the condyle and the coronoid.
The masseteric fossa is very wide and deep. The
angle of the ramus is broken, but evidently has no such
posterior extension as in <i>P. paludosus</i>. It thins out rapidly
behind.</p>

<p>Among other specimens obtained at the divide between
Henry's Fork and Cottonwood Creek, was a nearly complete
but somewhat shattered skeleton of a <i>Palæosyops major</i>,
found contiguous to the head of the same, parts of which are
just described. Portions of these are figured on a one fourth
scale in <a href="#Plate_2">Plate II</a>. The description is from a nearly perfect
atlas and axis, several cervical, dorsal, and lumbar vertebræ,
more or less complete, and a portion of the sacrum and
pelvis, in addition to several bones of the limbs.</p>

<p>The <i>atlas</i> has a broad inferior arch, contracted antero-posteriorly,
and deeply notched for the prominent odontoid
of the axis. The heavy superior arch, inclosing a large and
depressed neural canal, is capped by a low tuberosity. It
slopes into a flat, and very broad transverse process, which
thickens backwards, and is perforated by the vertebraterial
canal. Forwards the transverse process is notched for the
exit of the first spinal nerve. The anterior or condylar faces
are continuous, deeply concave from above downwards; and
slightly so from side to side; while the posterior faces are
oval, nearly flat, and directed backwards and inwards.</p>

<p>The <i>axis</i> is proportionately small, with a long opisthoc&#339;lous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[ 31 ]</a></span>
centrum, depressed, and produced forwards into a stout
conical odontoid process, and marked below by a strong
hypapophysial keel, which, developed on the latter half,
thickens backwards. The wide and thin pedicles inclose a
high neural canal, support the posterior zygapophyses and a
prominent and peculiar neural spine. The latter is flattened,
broad, and recurved posteriorly, thinning rapidly forwards
into a prow-shaped recurved edge. The transverse processes
arising from the latter half of the centrum are undersized
and widely perforated at base. The anterior faces are very
broad, directed outwards, and slightly rounded from above
downwards; they expand as they diverge (see Fig. 2). The
post-zygapophyses are small convex faces, projecting at the
base of the neural spine.</p>

<p>The <i>remaining cervicals</i>, five in number, are short, all
carinate, except the seventh, and opisthoc&#339;lous; with the
faces expanding only slightly beyond the body of the centrum.
A peculiar feature is a small pit upon the convex
anterior face, indicating either a ligamentous attachment
with the antecedent vertebra, or a remnant of the notochord.
This is a feature we have not noticed elsewhere. A long
and heavy transverse process supports a large and widely-perforated
inferior lamella. The pedicles are quite wide at
base, inclosing a large neural canal. The entire upper part
of the arch is unfortunately wanting.</p>

<p>The dorsal centra are smaller than the cervical, slightly
opisthoc&#339;lous, and carinate. They are sub-cylindrical anteriorly,
with decided costal surfaces before and behind;
approaching the lumbar region they become subtriangular.
A high neural arch supports a stout, but never very high
neural spine; this projects backwards, keeled in front, expanding
and deeply grooved behind. The zygapophyses are
small and nearly vertical. There is a short and thick transverse
process.</p>

<p>The <i>lumbar</i> vertebræ are long, decidedly opisthoc&#339;lous,
becoming wider and more depressed as they approach the
sacrum. The first <i>sacral</i> vertebra presents the same characteristics
as the last lumbar, only the body of the centrum is
slightly shorter. It has a very broad pleuropophysial plate.
The remaining sacral vertebræ are broad, and very greatly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[ 32 ]</a></span>
depressed, rapidly decreasing in size. The transverse processes
are slender. The very low neural spines anchylose
into a long ridge. The number cannot be ascertained, owing
to the fragmentary state of the sacrum. The caudals indicate
a tail of not very great length; as the neural canal is
small and persists in only a few of the anterior vertebræ.</p>

<p>The ribs, of which great quantities of fragments remain,
were slender and not of very great width.</p>

<p>The <i>femur</i>, which is figured in <a href="#Plate_1">Plate I.</a>, has a small head,
supported by a short neck. The shaft, very broad below the
head, supports the third trochanter one third of the way
down; below which it takes a cylindrical form, and expands
slightly above the trochlea. The two condyles, separated by
a wide and deep popliteal groove, are nearly subequal in
size&mdash;the internal somewhat the larger, while the trochlea is
long, narrow, and symmetrical. The great trochanter rises
slightly above the head, and overhangs a long and quite
deep digital fossa. The second trochanter is small. The
popliteal space is slightly concave.</p>

<p><i>Tibia.</i>&mdash;The proximal end of the tibia is very large, with
massive rugosities for muscular attachment. The two proximal
faces are subequal, slightly convex, and separated by a
prominent spine, which is grooved at the top. The shaft is
long, straight, and compressed antero-posteriorly; the anterior
ridge on upper third is very high, and expands into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[ 33 ]</a></span>
tuberosity, which is enormous; while on the posterior face is
a deep fossa just below the head. The distal end of the
shaft is remarkably small, with two concave faces&mdash;the internal
the smallest&mdash;with a low oblique ridge dividing them.
There is a prominent malleolus.</p>

<p>The fibula (which is a distinct bone) has a small proximal
end, and expands slightly below, with a large external malleolus.</p>

<p>The <i>pelvis</i> is described from the right and left ilia, which
are broken as they expand towards the crest; the acetabulum
is fragmentary, but all the parts remain. The ischium and
pubis are only represented by fragments. As figured in
<a href="#Plate_5">Plate V.</a>, the acetabulum is restored from a somewhat smaller
specimen. The most striking feature of the <i>ilium</i> is the long
and somewhat constricted neck. The acetabular border is
long and curved forward, thinning gradually as it approaches
the crest; and marked on the iliac surface, near the acetabulum,
by a slight rugosity for the rectus muscle.</p>

<p>The ischial border, while less arched, is probably longer;
and the sacral surface, distinctly defined, indicates that the
rounded upper border of the ilium rarely reached above the
sacral spines. There is a deep groove between the ischial
and pubic borders, the latter disappearing about half way up
the iliac surface. The gluteal surface near the acetabulum
is much depressed; above it expands into a broad, flat, thin
plate.</p>

<p>The <i>ischium</i> has a stout neck and thick expansion below;
the upper border is very heavy. From what remains of the
<i>ischium</i> and <i>pubis</i> we can infer a large elliptical obturator
foramen, a short pubic symphysis, a narrow and rather
slight pubis, with a small nearly cylindrical neck. The
acetabulum is deep, with a thick well-raised border, and a
large, oblong, and very deep pit for the ligamentum teres.</p>

<p>All the above were found at Henry's Fork Divide. In
another locality, in connection with a fine head of <i>P. major</i>,
was found the lower half of a <i>humerus</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>shaft</i> is cylindrical and twisted, expanding widely at
the distal end. Of the two condyles the external is the
largest; and, to quote from Dr. Leidy, "a deep supra-condylar
fossa occupies the front of the humerus, opposed by a
deeper and more capacious anconeal fossa." The greatest
breadth between the supracondyloid eminences is ·091 m.</p>

<p class="tdc">Cont. to Ext. Vert. Faun, <i>P. lævidens</i> Cope. U. S. Geol. Survey of Terrs, 1872,
p. 591.</p></div>

<p><i>Specific characters.</i>&mdash;Second superior molar has but one
outer tubercle. The cones are low as compared with <i>P. major</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[ 35 ]</a></span>
The cingula are much less developed. The angle of the
lower ramus is much longer. The zygoma is massive and
wide. An internal process on the glenoid cavity. Temporal
fossæ very deep. Crest of occiput nearly in same vertical
line as occipital condyles.</p>

<p>The full details of <i>P. paludosus</i>, which follow, may seem
somewhat unnecessary, to one familiar with the comprehensive
work of Dr. Leidy upon the subject. Care has been
taken not to retrace any of his steps; and the descriptions
given below are of those parts of the animal which he did
not possess at the time of writing. They include (1) a
cranium perfect posterior to the orbits; (2) a right <i>ramus</i>
mandibuli, with full dentition, except the first premolar; (3)
portions of the fore-limbs, scapula, and pelvis, pes and
manus, and many fragments of other parts.</p>

<p>Among the first discoveries on Cottonwood Creek, in a
stratum of fine green sand, was a head of <i>P. paludosus</i>, complete
posteriorly, and broken off just behind the orbit. A
rear view of this has been admirably figured in <a href="#Plate_1">Plate I</a>.</p>

<p><i>General appearance.</i>&mdash;The base of the cranium is of great
width; the occiput is high, inclined very slightly backwards,
and deeply concave from side to side. The forehead is triangular
and narrow. The temporal fossa is of immense size
and depth, leaving a small intracranial cavity. The zygomas
are heavy, and arching widely outwards give this part of the
head a strong resemblance to the <i>Felidæ</i>.</p>

<p><i>Description in detail.</i>&mdash;The narrow but prominent <i>basioccipital</i>
segment is broadest posteriorly and tapers forwards;
divided by a median ridge, which expands anteriorly into a
large tuberosity; a feature also characteristic of the tapir.
About half an inch in advance of the condyles are the condylar
foramina. The <i>condyles</i> are formed of the exoccipitals,
which are low and of great lateral expansion. Their junction
with the mastoids is marked by a large foramen. The <i>par-occipitals</i>
are short and styliform. The <i>supra-occipital</i> region is
very large, high, and deeply concave from side to side, much
wider than in the tapir, with a marked interparietal suture.
The <i>condyles</i> are wide, but not very deep, approaching each
other very closely below. The <i>basisphenoids</i> are long and narrow,
tapering forwards. The <i>alisphenoids</i> are mutilated, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[ 36 ]</a></span>
indicate large vertical ridges joining the parietals, and heavy
pterygoid processes, perforated at the base by the alisphenoid
canal. They are again perforated by the foramen ovale
three fourths of an inch behind this. This completes the
base of the skull.</p>

<p>The <i>parietals</i> are very large, they form nearly the whole
of the temporal fossil; which, deep and wide, enclosing a
small cranial cavity, contrast strongly with the long and
shallow temporal fossæ of the tapir. The parietal crest is
very broad, and grooved at the top. This high crest and
deep adjacent temporal fossæ we at first mistook as pointing
to an exclusively carnivorous type. The forehead has a triangular
appearance, from the divergence of the two side
ridges of the sagittal crest. The <i>postorbital</i> processes are
very large, but do not reach the opposing processes of the
<i>malar</i>. The orbit is thus left incomplete posteriorly, while in
form it greatly resembles that of the <i>Sus</i>. The <i>squamosal</i>
encroaches considerably upon the temporal; and sends outwards
and downwards a great zygomatic process, which
arches outwards from the skull as in the <i>Felidæ</i>, and is more
powerful than in any living carnivore (Leidy.) A strong
downward direction is especially characteristic, the whole
describing a sigmoid curve. The <i>mastoids</i> are of great size
vertically, and transversely they are confluent with the par-occipitals.
A low, thick process on the internal side of the
glenoid cavity prevents lateral motion.</p>

<p>The <i>nasals</i> are long, broad, and thick, convex from side to
side, narrowing slightly anteriorly. They are straight, as in
<i>Sus</i>, which they resemble more than they do either tapir
or rhinoceros. The anterior borders are rounded, and do
not reach as far forward as the symphysis of the premaxillary.
The <i>malar</i> is broad and thick, probably forming but
little of the face, being directed downwards and backwards
to meet the zygoma. The postorbital process is short, and
rather larger than Dr. Leidy has indicated. The <i>maxillaries</i>,
smaller proportionately than in <i>Sus</i>, form posteriorly the
floor of the orbit; while the infraorbital foramen is situated
over the last premolar. The premaxillaries fail to reach the
nasals.</p>

<p><i>Lower jaw</i> of <i>P. paludosus</i> described from another specimen.</p>

<p>The peculiar feature of this jaw is its remarkable extension
back of the molar series (a feature which has not been
noticed heretofore), the distance from the last tooth to the
angle being greater than the length of the entire molar
series. From beneath the last molar, the lower margin
curves gently up to the symphysis. The alveolar border is
but slightly curved. Behind the last molar the lower margin
forms a sigmoid curve, much more decided than in <i>P.
major</i> (first upwards and then downwards), and the ramus
thins out rapidly to the angle, where it has a slightly raised
border; at the diastema the ramus curves outwards so as to
throw the canines out of the line of the molars. The symphysis
is long.</p>

<p><i>Dentition.</i>&mdash;The incisors, three in number, from length
and shape indicate a semi-circular arrangement, as in most
Perissodactyles. They increase from first to third. The
crown of the first resembles very much that of the ruminants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[ 38 ]</a></span>
but has a straight posterior basal ridge. Its forward edge is
worn so as to expose a small tract of dentine. The second is
larger, but very much like the first in conformation; while the
third has an acute conical crown with a strong basal ridge.</p>

<p>Of the <i>premolars</i> the first is wanting in this specimen.
The second is bilobed, the anterior lobe much the larger. It
has a small accessory tubercle on its anterior slope. The
outer face is rounded, the inner nearly flat. The posterior
lobe is very small and obtuse, and with the inner face slightly
grooved. In third and fourth the valley between the lobes
and the groove on their faces enlarge; while the anterior lobe
becomes relatively smaller.</p>

<p>Among the first discoveries on Cottonwood Creek, in connection
with the lower jaw of <i>P. paludosus</i> just described,
were an ulna and radius, and part of the manus and scapula
of the same. These have been figured, together with other
fragments belonging to the same species, in <a href="#Plate_3">Plate III.</a>, and
form an interesting complement to the nearly complete hind
limb of <i>P. major</i> previously described.</p>

<p>The <i>scapula</i> has a shallow oval glenoid cavity, which is
concave longitudinally. Separated from it by a narrow notch
is a strongly recurved coracoid, placed on the inner side of
the bone. Above the coracoid the border is thin, and arches
inwards and then forwards; while the glenoid border is much
straighter, rising from a slight tuberosity. The spine rises
gradually from the glenoid, and does not bear any indication
of an acromion.</p>

<p>The <i>humerus</i> is represented by proximal and distal extremities.
The latter presents the same characters on a
smaller scale as in <i>P. major</i>. Upon the proximal end there
is a deep bicipital groove. The greater tuberosity has a
hooked anterior projection, and runs back into a ridge behind.
(See Fig 7, <a href="#Plate_3">Plate III</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[ 39 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The proximal end of the <i>ulna</i> (of median breadth anteriorly)
narrows into a prominent ridge behind. This gives a
trihedral character to the shaft. This is persistent, but is
less marked as the fore-and-aft diameter decreases. The
remaining features of note are a high tuberous olecranon
expanding behind; a shallow sigmoid, divided by a deep fossa
into two long divergent articular faces; a trihedral shaft
tapering slightly, but distinct from the radius; a narrow distal
extremity, with a small irregular face for the cuneiform.</p>

<p>The <i>radius</i> has a rather short shaft, curved forwards,
expanding below, and placed immediately in front of the ulna.
A strong ridge runs from the external tuberosity up the posterior
face of the shaft, disappearing two inches from the
top. The proximal end, fitting against the ulna by two small
faces, forms the greater part of the elbow-joint, a strong
median ridge dividing the proximal face into two subequal
surfaces with well-raised borders. The distal end of the
shaft is rugose, and more prominent than the proximal. It
has an oblong transverse face, which is slightly concave fore
and aft. The position of the radius, immediately in front of
the ulna, and its manner of articulation, remove any possibility
of rotation, a feature in strong contrast with what we
should expect from the character of the head.</p>

Superior size. In the upper molars two strong transverse
ridges connect the inner tubercle with the outer crescents,
inclosing a pit between them. In the premolars the outer
crescents fuse almost into a single ridge. These united crescents
are relatively narrower. The inner molars are also
narrower, and the posterior tubercle of the last is an elevated
cone.</p>

<p>Fragment of a lower jaw containing the two posterior
molars. The measurements of the teeth are identical with
those given by Professor Cope. The depth of the ramus
below the last molar is three and one third inches, and it is
slightly heavier below than in <i>P. major</i>.</p>

<p><i>Restoration of Palæosyops.</i>&mdash;The elevation of <i>Palæosyops
major</i>, which is taken as a type, was approximately the same
as that of <i>Palæotherium magnum</i> as restored by Cuvier.</p>

<p>The nearly complete ilium, femur, tibia, and tarsus of <i>P.
major</i> in our possession, enable us to make the following estimate
of the elevation of the hind quarters.</p>

<p>It is probable that the fore-shoulders were of the same
height. From the atlas, axis, and from other cervicals, several
dorso-lumbar vertebræ, and part of the sacrum, a rude
estimate places the length of the animal at sixty-seven inches,
or nearly six feet, including the head, and excluding the tail.</p>

<p>In general features it strongly resembled the tapir, with
stout body, slender tail, and very short neck, compensated by
a proboscis of considerable length. In comparing the heads
of the ancient and modern representatives of this class of
Perissodactyles, the points of contrast are the wide stout
zygomas, the deep temporal fossæ, the protruding nasals, and
the narrow gaps in the dental series of the older type.</p>

<p>There are also strong points of resemblance in the structure
of the <i>Palæosyops</i> and <i>Palæothere</i>. Some of the cranial
homologues have been detailed by Dr. Leidy. The femur of
the Palæothere is shorter, the tibia longer; they are both
much stouter. The tarsus of the <i>Palæosyops</i> is narrower,
while the remainder of the Pes is very similar. The pelvis,
and particularly the ilium and acetabulum of <i>Palæosyops</i>, is
more palæotheroid than tapiroid. The similarity of the fore-shoulder
in the two types is also striking. The neck of the
<i>Palæosyops</i> was probably shorter.</p>

<p>In the descending series of <i>Palæotheres</i> terminating in
the diminutive <i>P. minus</i>, and characteristic of the upper
eocene of France, we have an interesting counterpart in the
large family of <i>Palæosyops</i>, of equal diversity of size and
characteristic of our lower eocene, and it is hoped that future
discoveries will render a complete discussion of this interesting
coincidence possible.</p>

higher, with sharper cones and more erect external lobes.
Internal median valley very much deeper. Little or no
depression at the forehead; zygomatic arch round, comparatively
straight and does not project outwards, and with obscure

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Leurocephalus cultridens</span>, <i>Sp. Nov.</i></p>

<p>This species was considerably larger than <i>Palæosyops major</i>,
with which it shows affinities, as also with <i>Titanotherium
Proutii</i>. See <a href="#Plate_4">Plate IV</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Frontal</i> is narrow and flat, or slightly arched. It
sends out a strong curved postorbital process, which projects
outwards, but not so much outwards as in <i>Palæosyops</i>. The
sagittal crest runs back from the postorbital in a low rounded
ridge, rising but little as it recedes. The superciliary ridge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[ 43 ]</a></span>
is distinct, and is pierced by two small venous foramina. The
shape of the entire bone is much as we find it in the dog,
except that it does not arch so much. One of the most marked
differences between this genus and <i>Palæosyops</i> is here shown.
In the latter the forehead rises abruptly from behind the
orbit, while in the former there is only a slight rise for some
distance behind the orbit. As the bone is broken here, it is
impossible to state whether there is any rise at all. Probably
not, however. Below the postorbital process, on the
lateral aspect of the bone, there is a low ridge which separates
the orbit from the temporal fossa. The under surface of
the frontal is smooth.</p>

<p>The <i>Nasal</i>, of which but a small portion is preserved, is flat
on top, but bends downward at the angle.</p>

<p>The <i>Maxillary</i> is long and stout, over the last and penultimate
molars it broadens to form the floor of the orbit, which
is of unusual size. Between the canine and the malar the
maxillary arches inwards, forming a perceptible concavity, at
this point it reaches its greatest vertical height, as it rises to
join the nasal. The alveolar border is curved in two directions,
one with the convexity outwards, and the other downwards.
It exhibits no emargination in the diastema between
the canines and molars. The palatine plate is long, thick,
and narrow; it is flat fore-and-aft, but concave transversely,
owing to the elevation of the alveolus; the suture also is
raised slightly. In thickness it varies; being thickest between
the canine and the second premolar, and beyond this becoming
thinner. Its forward termination seems to be obtuse, running
for a short distance along the premaxillaries. The infraorbital
foramen is large, situated over the fourth premolar,
lower down, and nearer to the malar than in <i>Palæosyops</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Premaxillary</i> is rather short and stout; it is slightly
compressed, and ends in a sharp keel on top. Although not
so thick as in <i>Palæosyops</i>, it is much larger vertically. The
inner surface is ridged; it has no palatine process, and no
spine, so that the incisive foramen is large and undivided.
There was no symphysis between the two premaxillaries, they
do not show even any articular faces for each other, so that
they may not have been in contact during life. The animal
was adult, but not old. The incisive alveolus is short and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[ 44 ]</a></span>
straight, and is but little out of the line of the molars. There
is a very long diastema between the incisors and the canine,
and here the premaxillary is deeply notched to allow the passage
of the lower canine.</p>

<p>The <i>Malar</i> is very different in shape and size from the same
bone in <i>Palæosyops</i>. Its facial extent is greater, as it articulates
with the maxillary as far forward as the first molar.
It is not so broad from above downwards, but is considerably
thicker; the articulation with the squamosal is by flat surfaces.
The postorbital process is small and indistinct. The
orbit is of great size; its breadth, shown by the maxillary
floor is unusual, but its fore-and-aft diameter is extreme,
being nearly twice as great as in a large <i>Palæosyops major</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Squamosal</i> is a short, slender, and trihedral bone; it is
not at all like the squamosal of <i>Palæosyops</i>. It is smaller
even than that of <i>P. paludosus</i>; its outer margin is not turned
up, making the upper surface concave; it does not project
much outward, and scarcely at all downwards, as this is rendered
unnecessary by the flatness of the forehead. The chief
difference, in the size of this bone, between this genus and
<i>Palæosyops</i> is found in the much greater vertical and lateral
diameter of the latter; in length they are about equal. The
glenoid cavity is large, shallow, and transverse.</p>

<p>As a whole, the zygomatic arch is comparatively slender;
it is rounded, and does not project much laterally from the
side of the head; but its chief peculiarity consists in the fact
that it is nearly horizontal. It is thus altogether different
from the arch of <i>Palæosyops</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Occipital Condyles</i> are different from those of that genus.
They are flatter, shorter from above downwards, and proportionately
much smaller; but are expanded laterally in much
the same manner. At the border of the foramen magnum
they are gently rounded instead of having a sharp angle.
These borders are segments of circles, but as the condyles are
broken from the rest of the occiput, we cannot infer from this
the shape of the foramen.</p>

<p>The <i>Mandible</i> is long, stout, but comparatively shallow.
It is of nearly uniform thickness throughout, and does not
exhibit the thickening of the alveolus and thinning, of the
lower margin, which is shown in <i>Palæosyops</i>, especially in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[ 45 ]</a></span>
<i>P. major</i>; and the downward and inward arching of the alveolar
border is not marked to the same extent as in that species.
The lower border is nearly straight, and has but one slight
emargination just behind the symphysis. The ascending
portion of the ramus rises near the last molar quite abruptly,
and makes an angle of nearly 90° with the horizontal portion.
The masseteric fossa is shallow and obscure, and the anterior
bounding ridge is almost obsolete. This part of the jaw is
very different from any of the species of <i>Palæosyops</i>. The
symphysis is quite long, and extends back as far as the second
premolar; the chin is probably rounded. The dental foramen
is situated high up in the ascending portion of the ramus;
the mental foramen is placed below the second premolar; it
is large and single.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">DENTITION.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Upper Jaw.</span>&mdash;The incisors, three in number, are placed
close together in a nearly straight line, which does not make
so great an angle with the line of molars as in <i>Palæosyops</i>.
They increase regularly in size from the first to the third,
which is very large. They all have stout rounded fangs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[ 46 ]</a></span>
and sharp pyramidal crowns, with strong basal ridges separated
from the acute blades by deep clefts. Between the
incisors and the canine there is a long diastema.</p>

<p>The <i>canine</i> is of great size; it has a swollen fang, and a
long recurved crown which is much compressed, and has
sharp serrated cutting-edges. The external face is the more
convex, the internal has a well-marked basal ridge, and both
are longitudinally striated. The canine is separated from
the premolars by a short diastema.</p>

<p><i>Premolars.</i>&mdash;The first premolar stands by itself, separated
by a short interval from the second. It is implanted by two
fangs, and has a compressed crown with sharp cutting-edges.
It is nearly twice the size of the corresponding tooth in
<i>Palæosyops</i>, which is simple and conical. In the specimen
under description there is, besides the principal lobe of the
tooth, a rudimentary anterior lobe which gives the crown an
elongate shape. The basal ridge is shown on the inner side
only. The second premolar has a crown which is oval in
section. The external part consists of two sharp-pointed
cusps, separated by a valley, but confluent at base; while the
internal division is a low ridge (not a pointed cone as in
<i>Palæosyops</i>) with a tubercle developed behind it. The basal
ridge is marked all around, and sends up a buttress along the
antero-external lobe; as is also the case in the third and
fourth premolars. These are enlarged copies of the second;
but have the internal lobe elevated into a sharp cone, and
showing a much stronger basal ridge and deeper median valley.
These teeth differ in several respects from the premolars
of <i>Palæosyops</i>. The crowns are higher and the lobes sharper;
the basal ridge is more distinct, and is not interrupted at the
internal cusp; the external ascending buttress is stronger;
and there is no fold between the external lobes of the fourth.</p>

<p>The molars are constructed in a manner which resembles
that of <i>P. paludosus</i> rather than of <i>P. major</i>, but its
resemblance to the form shown in <i>Titanotherium</i> is stronger than
to either. They have broad, square crowns, which increase
progressively in size from first to last. There is a convexity
running up the median line of the external lobes, and the two
posterior lobes are connected together at their bases. The
first molar does not exhibit such a decided increase in size
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[ 47 ]</a></span>
over the last premolar as is seen in <i>Palæosyops</i>; the two external
lobes are more erect and sharper than in any form of
that genus. The cingulum is complete even across the
internal cones, and the median valley is very deep, as in
<i>Titanotherium</i>. There is a conspicuous fold at the junction
of the external lobes, and a minute tubercle between the two
anterior lobes; this tubercle is present only in the first
molar, and not throughout the series, as in <i>Palæosyops</i>. The
second molar in general form is like the first; but is larger,
has a deeper median valley, more conspicuous external folds,
and a stronger basal ridge. There is also some change in
the proportions of the crown; the first measuring the same
in both directions, while the second is wider than it is long.
The last molar has but one internal cone; the second is
represented by a tubercle; which however is a true rudimentary
lobe and not a development of the basal ridge. In
this tooth, the external fold is very large and the median
valley very deep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lower Jaw.</span>&mdash;The lower molars and premolars are very
much like those of <i>Palæosyops</i>, but are longer, narrower, and
higher. The incisors are not at all like <i>Palæosyops</i>, but are
compressed and laniariform, with acute crowns and sharp
cutting-edges. The canine is not present in our specimen;
but that it was large, is shown by the long diastema between
the upper canine and incisors.</p>

<p><i>Premolars.</i>&mdash;The first is small, simple, and implanted by a
single fang close to the canine. The diastema between it
and the second premolar is about one half of that in <i>P. major</i>.
The second premolar is the most peculiar tooth in the lower
series; as it carries the development of the anterior lobe at the
expense of the posterior lobe, to a still greater extent than in
<i>Palæosyops</i>., forming a crown like the blade of the carnivorous
sectorial. The third lobe of the last molar is no longer a
simple cone, but a functional lobe, with two crests running
from it, which bound a median valley.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Hyrachyus imperialis</span>, <i>sp. nov.</i></p>

<p>Established on the second and third molars of each upper
jaw, and three premolars, and one lower molar, portions of
the skull and vertebræ.</p>

<p>This species is, with the exception of <i>H. princeps</i>, (Marsh),
the largest species of the genus as yet known. It differs from
<i>H. princeps</i> in the greater proportionate length of the molars,
in their larger size, compared with the bulk of the animal, and
in the less separation of the anterior external conical buttress.
The third molar is the largest; the fold extending from the
antero-external lobe into the valley is very conspicuous. The
basal ridge (which is very strongly marked on the posterior
edge), is very feebly indicated on the exterior. The transverse
crests are more oblique in the second than in the third,
but in the latter the valley is deeper and the crests slightly
longer. The anterior conical buttress is of great size, being
larger than the anterior lobe. The premolars have, as usual,
one internal cone; the anterior and posterior external lobes
approach close together, while the accessory fold from the
anterior lobe becomes very prominent, reaching the internal
cone and enclosing a valley between itself and the transverse
crest. The basal ridge does not extend around the inner
part of the crown as in <i>H. agrarius</i>.</p>

<p>The only lower molar we have, seems to be a penultimate
molar of the right side. The basal ridge is large anteriorly,
very short posteriorly, but does not appear at all upon the
sides, as in <i>H. agrarius</i>.</p>

<p>The remaining bones of the skeleton indicate a rather
small animal, the teeth are therefore proportionately very
large.</p>

<p>The occipital condyles are small and sessile; they are
much extended laterally, and the external angles are pointed.
In other respects they resemble the condyles of <i>Palæosyops</i>.
The zygomatic arch is slender and does not curve outward
strongly. We cannot tell how far the malar encroaches upon
the face. After leaving the maxillary it becomes much compressed;
it has no postorbital process. The maxillary is of
unusual breadth, extends far backwards, and it forms the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[ 51 ]</a></span>
floor of the large orbit. The mandible is slender and compressed,
with a large dental canal.</p>

<p>The atlas is small, and has narrow transverse processes,
which are perforated by a large vertebraterial canal. The
dorsals have considerably depressed centra, and the ribs are
slender.</p>

<p>Established on the upper true molar series of the right
side.</p>

<p>This species is intermediate in size between <i>H. agrarius</i>
and <i>H. modestus</i>. As in the latter species; the basal ridge extends
around the entire crown of the tooth, with a small interruption
on the antero-external lobe. It is more pronounced,
in front and less behind than in <i>H. imperialis</i>. The anterior
conical buttress is not nearly so well developed as in <i>H. imperialis</i>;
the valleys are wide, and the descending fold from
the antero-external lobe is obscure, scarcely marked at all in
the first. The transverse crests are strongly arched forwards,
and the anterior is very much the longer. The peculiar feature
of the species is the position of the postero-externa,
lobe, which is pushed to the posterior aspect of the tooth;
this is carried so far in the last molar that the two external
lobes stand on nearly the same transverse line. The antero-external
lobe is much the highest point in the tooth, and its
the first molar is remarkably sharp. The enamel is considerably
wrinkled, but not nearly so much as in <i>H. modestus</i>.</p>

<p>Established on the left and a portion of the right ramus
mandibuli, containing the first molar.</p>

<p>The jaw presents some differences from the form common
in Hyrachyus. The alveolus is more curved, especially near
the ascending portion of the ramus; the jaw is narrower, and
is especially contracted near the incisive alveolus. The lower
margin of the ramus is but slightly curved. The ramus itself
thickens regularly from before backwards, and is thickest at
the last molar; beyond which it becomes thinner again. The
depth of the jaw is comparatively small, and the teeth have a
forward inclination; the mental foramina are not so large as
in other species of <i>Hyrachyus</i>, and are four in number.</p>

<p>The incisors are small, arranged in a semi-circle, and have
very much compressed fangs, with somewhat procumbent
crowns; the canines are small, and form a continuous series
with the incisors. There is a diastema between the canine
and first premolar; but one which is shorter than in known
species of the genus, and which does not indicate the usual
curve of the upper border of the ramus.</p>

<p>The molar series, (so far as can be judged from their broken
condition), are much the same as in other species; except, perhaps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[ 53 ]</a></span>
in the greater relative size of the posterior lobes, and
in the more complete closing of the median valley by the
junction of the two lobes externally. The ridge which curves
downwards and inwards from the external point of the anterior
lobe is unusually well developed, and curves across the
entire crown. The cingulum is feebly shown; it appears on
the anterior and posterior ends of the tooth (first molar) and
for a very short distance on the outside of the tooth opposite
the median valley; there is no trace of it on the inner side.</p>

<p><i>Lower Jaw.</i>&mdash;The ramus is stout, and resembles in general
form that of <i>Hyrachyus</i>, but the alveolar border is
straighter than in that genus; the ascending portion forms
a right angle with the horizontal portion, and the masseteric
fossa is deep. The symphysis is comparatively short, and
there is complete bony union between the rami, which do not
diverge so much as in <i>Hyrachyus</i>. As in that genus, there
are several small mental foramina beneath the premolar
series. The dental series forms a nearly continuous line, the
only diastema being a very short one between the first and
second premolars. The <i>incisors</i> have compressed fangs, and
are arranged in a slight curve. The canine is small and subcircular
at base. The <i>premolars</i> also are small; they somewhat
resemble those of <i>Hyrachyus</i> in shape, but are smaller,
and have the posterior lobe not so well developed. The
first is implanted by a single fang, the others by two. The
<i>molars</i> (except the last) consist of two pyramidal lobes,
which form transverse cutting-crests, as in <i>Tapirus</i> and
<i>Hyrachyus</i>. The basal ridge is shown on the anterior and
internal sides only. Externally the lobes meet at their bases,
inclosing the valley on that side. The last molar is by far
the longest of the series, and consists of three lobes, of which
the anterior is the largest, and the posterior the smallest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[ 55 ]</a></span>
The basal ridge at the anterior part of the tooth is very
strongly marked.</p>

<p><i>Upper Jaw.</i>&mdash;The molars increase in size from first to last
with considerable regularity. The premolars are small, and,
as in <i>Hyrachyus</i>, have one single internal cone, which is
joined by transverse ridges from the two outer cusps; the
anterior accessory tubercle is well developed. The first
molar is considerably larger than the last premolar; it is
much worn, and does not show anything more than that
there are two internal cones. The anterior conical buttress
is very largely developed throughout the true molar series.
The second and third molars resemble almost precisely the
corresponding teeth of <i>Hyrachyus</i>. Their shape, however,
is more nearly square than is usual in that genus.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">GENERA INCERTÆ SEDIS.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">ITHYGRAMMODON, <i>gen. nov.</i></p>

<p>Our fragments of this fossil show an animal about the size
of the llama, and approximating more closely to the <i>Tylopoda</i>
than to any living forms.</p>

<p>The genus is established upon the two premaxillary bones,
containing the incisors, parts of the maxillaries, the canine
and the first premolar; besides fragmentary portions of the
palatine plates. As the peculiar features of these remains
render them unique, we are warranted in establishing the
genus <i>Ithygrammodon</i>.</p>


<p class="tdc"><i>Generic characteristics.</i></p>

<p>The premaxillaries are long, narrow, and very straight,
bent slightly in on their own axis as in <i>Camelidæ</i>, but expanded
laterally at the end of symphysis as in <i>Pecora</i>. The
upward processes are sharply defined, with a wide, rounded
upper border.</p>

<p>The upper incisors are six in number, and <i>are placed nearly
in a straight line fore-and-aft</i>, separated from each other and
from the canine by small and subequal diastemas.</p>

<p>The <i>incisors</i> are nearly equal in size, cylindrical in shape,
are placed vertically in their alveoli, and are slightly recurved.</p>

<p>The spine of the premaxillaries is long and thin, giving
very long anterior palatine foramina, as in <i>Ruminantia</i>. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[ 57 ]</a></span>
premaxillaries, in position, are close together, showing a very
narrow muzzle.</p>

<p>The maxillaries have two well-developed canines, with
long, laterally compressed fangs, recurved and becoming circular
in section at the crowns. The diastema between the
canine and the first premolar is proportionate to that in <i>Procamelus</i>.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Ithygrammodon cameloides</span>, <i>sp. nov.</i></p>

<p class="tdc"><i>Specific characteristics.</i></p>

<p>The <i>premaxillaries</i> (See <a href="#Plate_10">Plate X.</a>, Figs. 1-4) are long, with
a wide, strongly upward curving process; from the premaxillary
symphysis to the third incisor, they increase in thickness;
then narrow slightly to the maxillary symphysis. The
upper margin of the process is smooth and narrow, curving
very gradually upwards; while the lower margin runs more
abruptly up, giving to it a strongly pointed curvature.</p>

<p>The outer surfaces are smooth and slightly convex; the
inner are marked by a wide deep canal running from just
behind the premaxillary symphysis into the maxilla.</p>

<p>The great size of this groove may perhaps be a generic
characteristic; as it is much larger than in <i>Protolabis</i>
(<a href="#Plate_10">Plate X.</a>, Fig. 6), the modern camels, or any of the other ungulates,
recent or fossil, that have come under our notice.</p>

<p>The premaxillaries do not co-ossify, as the spines are
smooth on their inner side. Just outside the spines, and in
front of the deep groove, the bones are marked by numerous
small pits for the attachment of the muscles of the upper lip.</p>

<p>The portion of the maxilla in which the first premolar is
situated, shows that the maxillaries swell considerably on
their alveolar border; for the canine then narrow gradually
for the first premolar diastema; then swell for its reception,
and become very thin in the diastema between the first and

<p>The incisors have quite deep fangs, are cylindrical in shape,
vertical in position, and have no basal ridge.</p>

<p>The crown of the first is worn perfectly smooth, flat across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[ 58 ]</a></span>
the top, unlike the wearing exhibited in any modern form
that has come under our notice. The others have their
crowns broken, but indicate a nearly subequal series, with the
last slightly the largest.</p>

<p>The canines have long, recurved compressed fangs, with
rather short crowns, which are circular in section. They
are much larger than in <i>Procamelus</i> or <i>Protolabis</i> of Pliocene,
or the modern camels. (See <a href="#Plate_10">X.</a>, Figs. 3, 5, 6, 7.)</p>

<p>The first premolar is the only one of the molar series preserved;
its crown is chipped considerably, but nevertheless
shows that it had one fang and no basal ridge. It resembles
the incisors in form, but is slightly narrower and longer.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Ithygrammodon</i> has been placed for the present
under the <i>genera incertæ sedis</i>; but its chief features point to
an unmistakable affinity with the ruminants. It is probable
that <i>Ithygrammodon</i> was the representative and the ancestor,
in the eocene age, of that type of ungulates of which the
camel and llama are the modern forms.</p>

<p>The line of descent of the camels was first indicated in
the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy, 1875, p. 262;
then in the Bulletin No. I, 1874, p. 25, of the U.S. Geological
Surveys of the Territories, (Government Report of Explorations
of 1873, pp. 498-500); and lastly in U. S. Geographical
Surveys of Territories, vol. iv., pp. 341-44.</p>

<p>In the above writings, Professor Cope traces the development
of the modern camels from the miocene genus <i>Poëbrotherium</i>,
Leidy, showing the modifications found in <i>Procamelus</i>,
Leidy, and <i>Protolabis</i>, Cope, of the succeeding age.</p>

<p>From the last work (Wheeler's Survey, vol. iv., p. 342),
we will quote at length:</p>

<p>"The evolution of the existing types of Camelidæ is a good
illustration of the operation of the laws of acceleration and
retardation. In evidence of this we may follow the growth
of the foot and dentition of the most specialized, and therefore
the terminal genus of the series, the American <i>Auchenia</i>
----. It is well known since the time of Goodsir, that the
embryos of ruminants exhibit a series of superior incisor
teeth which disappear early. It is probable, but not certain,
that in the miocene genus <i>Poëbrotherium</i>, as in various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[ 59 ]</a></span>
contemporary selenodont artiodactyla, the superior incisors
persisted. I have, however, discovered that these teeth persisted
in the Loup-Fork genus <i>Protolabis</i> during adult life.
I have found that one (the second) of these teeth in <i>Procamelus
occidentalis</i> persisted, without being protruded from the
alveolus, until nearly adult age.</p>

<p>"In genera (<i>e.g.</i>, the bunodont artiodactyla) where the incisors
are normally developed, they appear at about the same
time with the other teeth, and continue to develop to functional
completeness. This development is retarded in <i>Protolabis</i>,
since they are not so matured as to remain fixed
throughout life in their alveoli.</p>

<p>"In <i>Procamelus</i>, the retardation is still greater, since the
first incisor reaches very small dimensions, and is, with its
alveolus, early removed; while the second incisor only grows
large enough, and for a sufficient time, to occupy a shallow
alveolus, without extending beyond it. In the first incisor
the process of retardation has reached its necessary termination,
<i>i.e.</i>, atrophy or extinction; while in the existing <i>Camelidæ</i>
the second incisor also has disappeared the same way.
In ruminants other than <i>Camelidæ</i>, the third or external incisor
has undergone the same process, while in the <i>Bovidæ</i> the
canines also have been retarded in development, down to
atrophy."</p>

<p>Professor Cope continuing the discussion of the teeth of
these types, generalizes: "From these and many analogous
cases, the general law may be deduced that <i>identical modifications
of structure, constituting evolution of types, have supervenea
on distinct lines of descent?</i>"</p>

<p>This summary of Professor Cope's conclusions has been
necessary to show clearly in this series the probable place of
the eocene genus.</p>

<p>From the shape of the premaxillaries and maxillaries, and
the form and position of the teeth the camelline affinities have
been indicated. Future research must be relied on to throw
light upon the structure of the limbs and the axial skeleton;
as it is from these that the conclusive proof must be
deduced that <i>Ithygrammodon</i> is the ancestor of the camels,
and that <i>Poëbrotherium</i> is the second link in the chain, instead
of the progenitor.</p>

superciliary margins. The cervical vertebræ are rather
long; the sacrum has four vertebræ; and the tail is quite
long, very flat and broad. The tibia has its proximal face
divided by a prominent ridge into two parts. The dental
formula for the upper jaw is: I. 0, C. 1, M. 6. The molars
are small, and increase from first to sixth. The last is much
the largest; in it the anterior lobe considerably exceeds the
posterior in size, and there may or may not be a tubercle at
the entrance of the valley between the lobes; but there is

<p>Established upon a head and nearly perfect skeleton of
one individual, and parts of two more.</p>

<p>In this species, as in most others of the sub-order, the
nasals are of immense length and thickness; they overhang
the anterior nares, and project considerably beyond the premaxillaries;
they form more than half of the entire length of
the skull, articulating with the frontals somewhat behind
the orbits; the median suture is distinct throughout.
Instead of having an expanding shovel-shaped forward projection,
as in <i>Loxolophodon</i>, they narrow from the median
osseous projections (horn cores?) anteriorly. Above the
muzzle they are strongly curved from side to side, on their
upper surface forming a continuous arch; on the under surface
of each bone is a deep concavity, separated from its
fellow by the sutural ridge, which disappears forwards, near
the extremity. On the upper surface of each nasal, near the
forward end, is a large osseous tuberosity which is directed
forwards and outwards; these processes are much smaller
than the corresponding ones in the <i>Loxolophodon</i>, while
they are larger, of different shape and direction from those
in <i>Dinoceras</i>. In this species they are divided throughout
by a deep median groove, which anteriorly becomes a fissure,
and separates the extremities of the nasals completely. In
front of these tuberosities, the nasals taper very rapidly, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[ 64 ]</a></span>
end in sharp points which project downwards and forwards;
this portion of the bones is shorter, sharper, and projects
more decidedly downwards than in <i>Dinoceras</i>. Above and
slightly behind the sockets of the cranium, the nasals and
maxillaries give rise to the median pair of osseous projections.
These are very large, subtrihedral at the base, and
project upwards, outwards, and strongly forwards. They
differ from the corresponding processes in <i>Dinoceras</i>, in their
forward projection, in being longer and more everted, and in
their approach to each other at the base. They taper quite
regularly from base to tip, but do not come to a point; a
section here would be subcircular. They are not so long
and are not knobbed at the ends as in <i>Loxolophodon</i>. Their
inner curve is convex, the outer concave; converging below
at an angle of 90°, they are united by a strong ridge, which
is raised decidedly above the surface of the nasals. At their
posterior insertion they touch the frontals, lachrymals, and
malars. It is probable that the nasals send up processes on
the internal and posterior side of these median projections;
the sutures between these and the maxillary portions are
marked by slight ridges.</p>

<p><i>Frontals.</i>&mdash;In our specimen it is very difficult to determine
the exact relations of these bones. The nasals narrow at
their posterior end, and articulate with the frontals by a
V-shaped suture which thus encloses them on each side. It
is probable that the frontals run to some point between the
posterior or parietal projections. If we have discovered the
suture, they overlap the parietals, sending up V-shaped
processes, which join the sides of the posterior cranial projections,
and form a deep concavity with them. They constitute
a large part of the interior wall of the orbit, but have
no postorbital processes; the superciliary ridge is very
strong, and gradually rises into a large rounded crest, which
joins the posterior projection. The frontal eminences are
large, and situated immediately over the lachrymals. The
upper surface of the frontals is marked by two high ridges,
which probably represent the divided parts of the sagittal
crest; they rise from the anterior margin of the bones, and
are strongest above the frontal eminences. They converge,
and then diverging, together forming an X-like curve (without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[ 65 ]</a></span>
crossing, however), gradually disappear posteriorly.
These various ridges form four deep concavities on the
upper surface of the skull: (1) The largest already mentioned,
between the parietals and the posterior part of the
frontals; (2) that marked by the suture between the nasals
and frontal, not so large; (3 and 4) two much smaller
lateral ridges between the sagittal and superciliary ridges.
This great irregularity of the upper surface of the head is, so
far as is yet known, peculiar to <i>Uintatherium</i>.</p>

<p><i>Parietals.</i>&mdash;The peculiar feature of these bones is the huge
pair of projections (the so-called "posterior horn cores") to
which they give rise. The outer margin of these processes
is nearly straight; the inner margin for its upper two thirds
is also straight, the lower third curving in a high strong ridge
to meet its fellow. The anterior face is rounded and produced
into the long crest of the frontals, while the posterior
face is flattened and produced into a similar but shorter and
higher crest which joins the supra-occipital. At the base of
these processes their greatest diameter is fore-and-aft, while
at the top it is transverse. They project upwards and outwards,
but are not curved as in <i>Dinoceras</i>, nor are their
upper borders so much arched. Their greatest diameter at
top is at right angles to the corresponding measurement in
this last-named genus. Behind the ridge which connects
these projections, the parietals curve sharply upward to a
high occipital crest; between which and the projections they
form a deep basin whose floor is raised above that formed by
the frontals immediately anterior to it. This arrangement
differs from that of both <i>Loxolophodon</i> and <i>Dinoceras</i>, especially
from the latter. The temporal fossæ are of great
length, deeply concave, but rather low from above downwards,
formed almost entirely by the parietals, and bounded
posteriorly by a sharp outward curve of these bones. They
are of about the same proportionate length, but higher and
very much deeper than in <i>Loxolophodon</i>; and are not nearly
so long as in <i>Dinoceras</i>, in which genus the parietals expand
far behind the horn-like processes. In our specimen the posterior
part of the fossa is pierced by numerous small venous
foramina, and corresponds precisely in every way, save that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[ 66 ]</a></span>
of size, to the specimen figured by Dr. Leidy. (Cont. to Extinct
Vert. Fauna, Plate XXVI., Fig. 1.)</p>

<p><i>The Squamosals</i> are large and heavy but encroach little
upon the temporal fossæ; they are situated directly below
the large parietal projections. The glenoid cavity is transverse
and straight in this direction, broad and shallow, with
no internal process; and the post-glenoid process is long and
massive. The zygomatic process is short, stout, high, and
trihedral, with a strongly arched upper margin. The articulation
with the malar is by a straight, flat face, and anchylosis
of the two never takes place. The anterior termination is
pointed, and the outer margin is rounded.</p>

<p><i>The Malars</i> form none of the face. They are long,
slender, curved downwards and backwards, and but little
outwards. They are longer, straighter, and less curved outwards
than in either <i>Loxolophodon</i> or <i>Dinoceras</i>; they do not
present the sharp angle in the lower margin shown in the
latter genus, nor are they so extensively overlapped by the
zygomatic processes of the squamosal. Posterior to the
molar series, the malars are greatly compressed and very
slender, but at the junction with the maxillaries they become
much wider and thicker. There is no trace of a postorbital
process; and the projections from the under surface of the
bone at their junction with the squamosals, so prominent in
Dinoceras, are here rudimentary or absent. As a whole, the
zygomatic arch is very long, slender, simple, curved upwards
and very slightly outwards, so slightly that it is completely
overhung by the superciliary ridge and frontal crest.</p>

<p><i>The Lachrymals</i> are unusually large, and form the anterior
part of the orbit; they encroach considerably upon the face,
and articulate with the superciliary ridges above. The
lachrymal foramen is very large.</p>

<p><i>The Maxillaries</i> are of great length, being nearly as long
as the nasals. They extend somewhat beyond the last molar;
but the suture between them and the pterygoids is very
obscure. There is a very long diastema between the canine
and molar series, and the lower margin is arched upwards;
above this, between the orbit and the socket of the canine,
there is a large, deep fossa, but we can discover no infraorbital
foramina. The sockets of the canines are very large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[ 67 ]</a></span>
and prominent, they curve upwards and backwards to the
base of the median cranial projections, but these are not excavated
to receive them, as is the case in <i>Dinoceras</i>. The most
peculiar feature of the maxillary bones is the pair of large
horn-like projections, to which, in conjunction with the nasals,
they give rise. These have already been described, and it
only remains to add that they correspond in position to those
of <i>Dinoceras</i>, and are therefore much further forward than
those of <i>Loxolophodon</i>.</p>

<p>The palatine plates of the maxillaries are long and very
narrow; they are concave transversely, and are separated
from each other by a high median ridge. The posterior
palatine foramina are small.</p>

<p>The <i>Palatines</i> are very short, narrow, and concave, and are
separated by a ridge. They are considerably excavated on
the posterior border, in this respect differing from <i>Loxolophodon</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Pterygoids</i> and the pterygoid plates of the alisphenoid
are compressed; the former join the alveolar borders of
the maxillary, which are produced somewhat beyond the last
molars. The alisphenoid canal is very large, but rather
short.</p>

<p>The <i>Premaxillaries</i> are of very peculiar shape, somewhat
like a <i>u</i>, with one side&mdash;the lower&mdash;the longer. The upper
portion articulates with the nasals, running along the narial
opening to about three inches from the angle; the free portion
is short, slender, and tapering; it is curved downwards
and slightly inwards; the premaxillaries do not meet, leaving
the incisive foramen unenclosed, and are edentulous. At the
end of the upper portion there are prominent processes for
the attachment of the muscles of the proboscis, which probably
resembled that of the tapir.</p>

<p>The anterior narial opening is very large, but is considerably
concealed by the overhanging of the nasals. There is no
osseous septum between the nostrils. The posterior nares
are much smaller, being especially contracted in width; it is
divided above by the <i>Vomer</i>, which is very short, and does
not reach the palatines. The nasal cavity thus formed is
long, straight, and gradually narrows backwards.</p>

<p>Of the Mandible we have but a small portion of the right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[ 68 ]</a></span>
ramus, comprising the part opposed to the upper canine, from
the dental canal downwards. The jaw at this place has a large
downward-projecting process, very similar to that figured by
Marsh in his plate of <i>Dinoceras laticeps</i>. This process curves
slightly outward, and has its external side convex in both
directions, and its internal side convex fore-and-aft, concave
from above downwards. The posterior mental foramen,
which is the only one preserved in our specimen, corresponds
in size and position with <i>Dinoceras laticeps</i>. The only difference
between the two is a very slight one: in <i>D.</i> the curve
of the posterior margin of the process is convex; in <i>Uintatherium</i>
it is concave; the angle which the process makes
with the jaw is also greater.</p>

<p><i>Teeth.</i>&mdash;These are peculiar for their small size compared
with the bulk of the animal; for their slender fangs, and for
the distance through which these are exposed.</p>

<p><i>Upper Jaw.</i>&mdash;Formula: I. <sup>0</sup>/<sub>0</sub>, C. <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub>, Pm. <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, M. <sup>3</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p><i>Canines.</i>&mdash;The sockets of these teeth have been already
described: the fangs are very long, somewhat longer than the
crown, and the teeth apparently grew from permanent pulps.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[ 69 ]</a></span>
The crown is long, compressed and recurved; the posterior
margin is sharp, and exhibits some indications of a slight serration.</p>

<p><i>Premolars.</i>&mdash;The first premolar is not preserved in our
specimen. The second and third are subequal, and of about
the same conformation. They are implanted by three fangs,
one internal and two external. The crown is subcircular at
the base. The basal ridge is large, and completely surrounds
the crown; above this the crown becomes somewhat trihedral:
and is composed of two pyramidal lobes, which meet internally
and externally, and are divided by a valley. The
summits of the lobes form transverse grinding ridges; the
anterior one is the lower, and is crescent-shaped, while the
posterior is straight; the anterior ridges throughout the
series are much the most worn. The basal ridge is not
indented on the outer side at the opening of the valley as in
<i>Dinoceras</i>.</p>

<p><i>Molars.</i>&mdash;The true molars increase in size regularly backwards.
The first molar is larger than the last premolar;
it is worn down nearly to the basal ridge, but shows a small
internal accessory tubercle on the back part of the posterior
lobe. The extremities of the lobes rise into points, and their
summits are transversely concave. The number and arrangement
of the fangs in the first and second molars is the same
as that of the premolars; in the last molar there are but two,
which are long and wide, and extend the whole breadth
of the crown. This tooth is by far the largest of the molar
series; it is ovoidal in shape, with the apex at the outer point
of the forward lobe; it is proportionally broader than in <i>Uintatherium
robustum</i>. The basal ridge is strong, and extends
around the entire tooth, with some irregularities of outline at
the sides. This tooth, like the others, consists of two pyramidal
lobes separated by a valley, which in this case is wide
and deep. The summit of the anterior lobe is the longer, and
extends obliquely across the crown, while the posterior is
nearly straight. The free ends and junction of the lobes are
prolonged into points, which give a tripodal character to the
crown. The outer point of the anterior lobe is the longest
of the three, but the difference is not nearly so marked as in
<i>U. robustum</i>; the other two are of about the same height;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[ 70 ]</a></span>
but the external is spinous in character, while the internal is
stout and obtuse. The anterior slope of each lobe is steep,
while the posterior is long and gentle. As in <i>U. robustum</i>,
there is a small rounded tubercle on the inner side of the posterior
basal ridge; but there is no tubercle occupying the
entrance of the triangular valley between the lobes. The
enamel of all the molars is smooth.</p>

<p><i>Lower Jaw.</i>&mdash;Dr. Leidy has very kindly sent us some of
the lower molars of an undescribed <i>Uintatherium</i>, which may
belong to this species. They consist of the anterior lobe of
the last molar, and second and third premolars entire. They
all have nearly the same conformation, consisting of three
acute pyramidal lobes, of which the anterior is very much
the highest and broadest; the median lobe is partly separated
from the anterior by a valley which opens outwards, while
the valley between the posterior and median lobes passes
completely across the tooth. The highest point of the crown
is the inner end of the anterior lobe; but the difference between
this and the outer end, very great in the molars, becomes
slight in the premolars. The inner end has an accessory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[ 71 ]</a></span>
tubercle just at the lip of the anterior lobe, and there is
another on the anterior basal ridge. This latter feature
would seem to distinguish it from <i>U. robustum</i>.</p>

<p>The basal ridge is distinct in front and behind, indistinct
on the external side, and entirely absent from the internal.</p>

<p class="tdc pmt1"><i>Vertebræ.</i></p>

<p><i>Cervical region</i> (<a href="#Plate_6">Plate VI.</a>, Fig. 1).&mdash;(Only one preserved,
probably fifth or sixth.)</p>

<p>The centrum is short, compared with the dorsals, but is
much longer than the cervical centra of the <i>Proboscidea</i>; it is
broad and depressed, oval in form, and slightly opisthoc&#339;lous.
The zygapophyses are developed upon tuberous projections
of the pedicles; they are large, flat, and in the same plane with
each other. The diapophyses are very slender and short, and
but slightly heavier than the parapophyses, with which they
unite, enclosing a large vertebraterial canal. At the anterior
margin of the parapophysis, a small pointed process projects
downward.</p>

<p>The pedicles are low and very heavy, bounding a narrow
neural canal.</p>

<p>The epiphyses are not so completely ossified as they are
in the dorsal region.</p>

<p><i>Dorso-lumbar region</i> (<a href="#Plate_6">Plate VI.</a>, Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5),&mdash;(Description
based upon nine dorsals and two lumbar vertebræ.)</p>

<p>The centra are large, subtriangular, and slightly compressed;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[ 72 ]</a></span>
they are opisthoc&#339;lous, but less so than in the <i>Proboscidea</i>.
They increase in size slowly but regularly from
before backwards. In the middle dorsal region they are excessively
expanded laterally for the posterior-costal attachments;
but become less broad and higher as they recede in the
series. In the middle of the series the centra are marked by
a prominent hypophysial keel.</p>

<p>In the anterior dorsals the costal surfaces are developed
almost entirely upon the pedicles, and are two in number.
These are very large in about the sixth and seventh, and meet.
They decrease in size as they recede. In the middle region
the posterior costal surfaces are small, lozenge-shaped facets,
and are developed upon thin lateral projections of the centra.</p>

<p>The centrum of the last dorsal is heavy, resembling the
centra of the lumbar, from which it is distinguished by a
single pair of small costal surfaces, developed, half on the
pedicles and half on the centrum.</p>

<p>The neural spines are markedly smaller than those of the
<i>Proboscidea</i> and <i>Rhinoceros</i>; in the anterior part of the dorsal
region the spines have the same angle as the corresponding
ones in <i>Mastodon</i>. The spines of the twelfth and thirteenth
(approximately) are much expanded at the ends and
bifid; in the last dorsals they are wide, straight, and very
thin; in the lumbar region they are short, stout, tuberous, and
stand almost at right angles to the axis of the vertebræ. The
laminæ in the anterior part of the series are long and thin,
decreasing in length but increasing in thickness from before
backwards. The zygapophyses in the fore part of the dorsals
are mere flat facets on the laminæ; they increase in size and
become characteristic in the posterior part of the dorsal
region. The pre-zygapophyses of the last lumbar vertebra
are very large, deeply concave, and parallel with the axis of
the column. The metapophyses appear in the middle of the
series, and regularly increase in size to the last lumbar. From
their appearance the pre-zygapophyses are developed upon
them.</p>

<p>The transverse processes present the most unique feature
of the vertebral column. In the anterior region they are
long, wide, and rugose, and in the same plane with the laminæ;
they send directly out wide, downward-curving projections.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[ 73 ]</a></span>
In the middle dorsal region the transverse processes lose these
thin projections, and become heavy and subtrihedral, with a
smooth facet on their lower face for articulation with the
tubercle of the rib; their upper face is here a little twisted
from the plane of the laminæ. In the posterior dorsal region
the transverse processes lose the facet for the articulation with
the tubercle of the rib, and become short and very thin, pointing
slightly backwards.</p>

<p>The lumbar transverse differ from those of the last dorsal
in having a median transverse ridge on their posterior face,
and are directed more vertically out.</p>

<p>The pedicles throughout most of the dorsal series are
short, heavy, and deeply notched behind. In the posterior
dorsal region they become longer and more slender, resembling
almost exactly the pedicles of the lumbar region.</p>

<p><i>Sacral region.</i>&mdash;The sacrum is composed of four vertebræ,
three true and one pseudo-sacral. The centra are extremely
depressed, and rapidly decrease in width and thickness from
before backwards. The first is shorter than the last lumbar,
but much longer than the other sacrals, which are subequal.</p>

<p>The face of the first is elliptical, and is nearly three times
the diameter of the fourth, longitudinally. The metapophyses
are exceedingly large and tuberous on the first; with
wide, deeply concave pre-zygapophyses developed upon
them; in the other three the metapophyses are rudimentary.</p>

<p>The transverse processes are long and wide in the first
three; widest in the first but thickest in the second; long and
thin in the fourth. The pleuropophysial segments of the true
sacrals are very heavy.</p>

<p>The foramina enclosed by the transverse processes are
large; and have, on the internal side, their long diameter
obliquely transverse to the axis of the sacrum.</p>

<p>The inferior faces of the centra are slightly concave in the
first three. The first and fourth have slight hypophysial
keels.</p>

<p>The neural canal is very wide and depressed in the first,
but decreases rapidly backwards, becoming extremely small
in the last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[ 74 ]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Caudal region</i> (<a href="#Plate_6">Plate VI.</a>, Fig. 6).&mdash;(Description based upon
the first four.)</p>

<p>The centra of the caudal vertebræ are rather long, narrow,
and greatly depressed in the middle; they decrease in size
gradually backward. The pedicles and laminæ are short and
thin, enclosing a small neural canal. The neural spines point
directly back, being almost parallel with the axis of the centrum.
They are slender and tuberous at the extremity. The
transverse processes are very long, wide, and thin, thickened
somewhat at the ends, and project directly out; they decrease
in size backwards. From the persistence of the neural canal,
and from its comparative size, it would seem as if the tail
was considerably larger than that of the elephant.</p>

<p><i>Ribs.</i>&mdash;Description based upon two perfect ones, and parts
of four more.</p>

<p>The ribs, as in <i>Dinoceras</i>, "resemble very much those of
the Mastodon." The capitulum has two convex facets, separated
by a narrow groove. The sternal end in one is very
much expanded, but less so in the other. The tubercle is
small, and is situated upon the prolongation of the lamelliform

<p><i>Scapula</i> (<a href="#Plate_8">Plate VIII.</a>, Fig. 1).&mdash;The scapula is subtriangular,
with the pre-scapular border as base, and the apex half way
up the postscapular.</p>

<p>On the external side the pre-scapular fossa is concave antero-posteriorly,
and plane in the direction of its length; it is
very thin in the middle, but becomes heavier at the lateral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[ 76 ]</a></span>
border. The postscapular fossa is larger and less concave;
both fossæ, as they approach the upper border, gain greatly
in thickness.</p>

<p>The spine rises from the supra-scapular border, and extends
to within an inch from the glenoid cavity. It is decidedly
antroverted; thickest and highest near glenoid cavity;
thinnest and lowest in the middle, expanding again at its
upper extremity; its acromio-scapular notch is long and
shallow. The acromion is rudimentary.</p>

<p>The coracoid process is a low, rugose tuberosity; the
coraco-scapular notch is short and low.</p>

<p>The internal surface of the scapula has a large, smooth
median ridge, extending the whole length of the bone, separating
it into slightly concave fossæ. About two thirds up,
the median ridge sends obliquely up two branches, forming a
V, superimposed upon the main ridge; but these disappear
before they reach the upper extremity. The whole inner
surface is curved outward, presenting a concave appearance
throughout.</p>

<p>The glenoid cavity is deep, ovoid in form, with its greatest
diameter fore-and-aft, and its smaller end behind.</p>

<p>The resemblance between the scapula of <i>Uintatherium</i>
and that of the <i>Proboscidea</i> is more closely marked than in
any other corresponding bones. The chief points of similarity
are: first, the subtriangular shape; second, the same
relative proportions between the fossæ; third, the antroversion
of the spine; fourth, the glenoid cavity looking directly
down. The marked points of difference may be summed
up as, first, in the dissimilar proportion of the glenoid
cavity; second, the great thickening of the spine at its
upper and lower extremities; third, in the high, shallow
acromio-scapular notch; fourth, in the longitudinal concavity
of the internal surface.</p>

<p><i>The Humerus</i> (<a href="#Plate_7">Plate VII.</a>, Fig. 1).&mdash;The humerus is
short, but excessively stout, twisted slightly on its axis; it
decreases gradually in size downward, with the smallest
diameter about two inches below the end of the deltoid
ridge. The head is large, hemispherical, and sessile, projecting
very slightly out of the axis of its shaft. The great
tuberosity is heavy, but not high, and is separated from the
low lesser tuberosity by a shallow bicipital groove.</p>

<p>The trochleæ are very nearly equal in size, directed obliquely
to the axis of the shaft, and are separated by a narrow
groove, which runs from the supra-trochlear fossa down and
in, then back and up to the anconeal fossa. The condylar tuberosities
are large and rugose; the external is the greater, and
is directed antero-posteriorly. The deltoid ridge is long and
heavy, and extends nearly two thirds down the shaft, branching
out into two forks near its end. The supinator ridge is
short and rudimentary, differing in this respect entirely from
the great development found on the humerus of the <i>Proboscidea</i>.</p>

<p>The supra-condylar fossa is small, subcircular in form, and
very deep, it has the peculiarity of being placed above the
external condyle alone. The anconeal fossa is median in
position and quite deep.</p>

<p><i>Pelvis.</i>&mdash;The <i>ilia</i> are greatly expanded laterally, with
the iliac surface concave and the gluteal surface nearly
flat; thin in the middle, they increase in thickness near
the borders. The crests curve regularly, and project
above and beyond the sacrum, but do not bend over the
acetabula. The acetabular borders are only slightly concave;
the prominence for the attachment of the rectus
muscle (extensor) is low and V-shaped. The direct internal
surfaces of the ilia, comprised between the pubic and ischiatic
borders, become deeply concave below the ischiatic portion
of the acetabulum. The sacral surfaces are wide and triangular
in shape; above they project beyond the sacral
spines.</p>

<p>The ilio-lumbar angle is about 110°. The ischium is, short;
a section of it, as it leaves the acetabulum, is subtriangular;
but immediately it becomes flattened fore-and-aft throughout
its plane of 90° to the axis of ilium; then verging toward the
pubic symphysis it becomes small. The tuberosity of the
ischium is small and directed up.</p>

<p>The pubis, as it leaves the acetabulum, is sub-cylindrical,
after this it is flattened in the same plane with the ischium.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[ 79 ]</a></span>
The bone as a whole is short, thin, and slightly curved on its
own axis; its smallest part makes up the pubic symphysis,
which is short. The thyroid foramen is a large oval, with its
long diameter parallel to the axis of the ischium.</p>

<p>The acetabulum is large, subcircular, and deep, with
prominent borders; especially the iliac, which is produced
on its external extremity into a point; the ischiatic is deeply
notched. From the wide ligamentous pit in the centre
there runs a deep groove part way down the antero-external
side of the ischium.</p>

extremities. The proximal end is especially massive, with
deeply concave articular faces; the internal cotylus is the
larger, and has its greatest diameter fore-and-aft, directly at
right angles to the greatest diameter of the external.</p>

<p>The cotyli are separated by a smooth ridge, that is highest
at its posterior termination. The tuberosity is high and massive,
with a wide depression on its top for the reception of
the ligament of the patella; the sides are deeply pitted by
venous foramina. A section of the shaft at the lower part of
the tuberosity would be subtriangular; while below it becomes
more cylindrical, as it becomes smaller, reaching its
shortest diameter about three fifths down the shaft. Below
this it expands and forms the large subcircular distal end.
The articular face is concave, with a slight, smooth ridge running
fore-and-aft on its internal side. The malleolus is broad
and low.</p>

<p>The <i>fibula</i> is distinct, but very slender; its proximal end
has a small circular face, which articulates with the tibia on a

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Uintatherium princeps</span>, <i>sp. nov.</i></p>

<p>Established on several portions of the head, vertebral column,
and the limbs.</p>

<p>This species may readily be distinguished from the last
by its larger size, the broad nasals with small tuberosities,
the stronger zygomatic arches, and the sub-cylindrical centra
of the dorsal vertebræ.</p>

<p>The <i>nasals</i> are broad and flat for some distance behind the
tuberosities. Although the animal was not adult, the nasal
suture is almost obliterated, and is visible only on the inferior
surface; in this respect it is very different from the <i>U.
leidianum</i>, in which the suture persists throughout life; as is
shown by the type specimen, which was past maturity. The
tuberosities of <i>U. princeps</i> are lower, broader, and more everted
than in the preceding species; are not divided by a groove,
but united together by a low rounded ridge, to which the surface
of the nasals gradually rises from behind. The portion
of the bones anterior is short, stout, and projects horizontally.</p>

<p>The <i>median</i>, or <i>maxillary</i>, <i>projections</i> are apparently short
and everted; they are somewhat compressed antero-posteriorly,
and enlarge rapidly downwards. They are transversely
oval in section.</p>

<p>The <i>posterior</i>, or <i>parietal</i>, <i>projections</i> are different from any
that we have yet seen. They are subtrihedral at base and
flattened antero-posteriorly above. The upper margin is
regularly arched, and is the thinnest portion of the process.
The posterior face is perfectly flat, and the parietal crest
makes a sharp angle with it, rising lower down than in <i>U.
leidianum</i>; the frontal crest is also lower down than in that
species, and the anterior face is strongly convex. The internal
margin is rounded and straight, and does not show the
longitudinal groove marked in the last species.</p>

<p>The <i>frontal</i> has the eminences and depressions common to
the members of the genus; but the superciliary ridge is unusually
sharp and sinuous in outline.</p>

<p>The <i>squamosal</i> is short, stout, and high; is but slightly
curved outwards, but apparently projects somewhat downwards.
The malar articulation is broad and flat, indicating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[ 82 ]</a></span>
the heaviness of that bone. As a whole the zygomatic arch
is stronger, and probably shorter, than in <i>U. leidianum</i>.</p>

<p>The occipital condyles are proportionately rather small;
they are placed on a long neck and project downwards.
They are strongly convex from above downwards, but
scarcely at all so from side to side. The internal border is
slightly emarginate.</p>

<p>The <i>dorsal vertebræ</i> are of about the same proportionate
length as in <i>U. leidianum</i>, but are higher and wider; and the
centra are subcircular in section, slightly contracted in the
middle. The costal surfaces are wide and deep, and vertically
oval in shape; they are placed partly on the centra and
partly on the neurapophyses. The transverse processes are
short, stout, and tuberous, and raised high above the centrum.
There is a deep notch at the posterior edge of this
process, at its junction with the neurapophysis. The neurapophyses
are trihedral, somewhat low, and very stout, forming
a wide neural canal.</p>

<p>The <i>ulna</i> (<a href="#Plate_7">Plate VII.</a> Fig. 2) is thick, with a long and rugose
olecranon. The shaft is long and stout; it shows a distinct
medullary cavity. The distal end is small, and shows a low,
heavy, styloid process.</p>

<p>A <i>metacarpal</i> resembles the corresponding bone in <i>Dinoceras</i>,
but is rounder and less rugose. There are two faces for
carpal articulations, which meet at an open angle.</p>

Surveys, p. 109 <i>et seq</i>.</p>

<p>This genus of the gnawers is very closely allied to the
squirrels and marmots. Dr. Leidy sums up the generic characteristics
of the teeth thus:</p>

<p>"The four lower molars are proportionately narrower than
in squirrels and marmots, the fore-and-aft exceeding the
transverse. The crowns are short, square, tuberculate, and
enamelled.</p>

<p>"The lower jaw is proportionately shorter and deeper than
in most known rodents; the reduction in length being mainly
due to a less development of that part of the bone in advance
of the molars. To compensate for the difference in length,
and to make room to accommodate the incisors, these teeth
reach further back than usual.</p>

<p>"The acute edge of the hiatus between the molars and incisors
is almost on a level with the alveoli, of the teeth, instead
of forming a deep concave notch, so conspicuous a feature in
the jaws of the gnawers generally."</p>

<p>Represented by a perfect skull, and several vertebræ.</p>

<p>This fossil exhibits a form of skull which shows characters
of both crocodile and alligator; the latter to a less marked
degree. That it properly belongs to the former genus is
shown by the notch in the upper jaw which receives the
canine of the lower.</p>

<p>The entire skull is remarkably flat on its upper surface,
the face and cranium being nearly in the same plane without
the descent at the frontals usual in these reptiles. The jaw
is deeply notched at the sutures between the maxillaries and
pre-maxillaries, and the second maxillary notch is well marked.
All the bones of the upper surface of the head are deeply
pitted.</p>

<p>The borders of the cranium are rounded as they approach
the orbits; the superior temporal orifices are almost perfectly
circular, the fore-and-aft diameter exceeding the transverse by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[ 86 ]</a></span>
only one millimetre. This effect may, in some degree, be due
to distortion.</p>

<p>To give a more detailed account of the several elements
of the skull, we take up first the <i>basioccipital</i>. This bone is
remarkably long and straight, tapers gradually downwards,
and becomes quite narrow at the distal end. It is smooth
throughout, and exhibits no rugose muscular attachments,
such as are sometimes seen in other members of the order.
The condyle is large and nearly spherical, but with median
groove distinctly marked. In size and shape it is more like
that of the alligator than of the ordinary crocodile, but it is
somewhat different from either. It differs from the former, in
not having so long a neck distinctly marked by a constriction;
and from the latter, in not having additional articular faces on
each side of the condyle proper. As far as can be judged, no
portion of it is formed by the exoccipitals. Below the condyle
the basioccipital is perforated by two small vascular
foramina; the spheno occipital canal occupies the usual place,
and is very large.</p>

<p>The <i>exoccipitals</i> are large, of very great width, but rather
low from above downwards. The position of the foramina
which perforate these bones is peculiar; it resembles more
the arrangement seen in the skull of the alligator than in that
of the crocodile, but it has an additional foramen. There are,
then, two small venous foramina near the condyle; while
along the lateral margin of the occiput, are placed in a vertical
line the foramina for the hypoglossal and pneumogastric
nerves, and the internal carotid artery. The foramen for the
facial nerve, etc., is situated in the usual place, and is of the
usual size. The foramen magnum is heart-shaped, low, wide
above, contracting below. The paroccipital processes are
long and slender, and project strongly backwards.</p>

<p>The <i>supra-occipital</i> is very small. It shows to some extent
on the upper surface of the skull, wedged in between the parietals.
As a whole, the occiput is of remarkable shape: it is
perfectly vertical, as in all other crocodilians; is remarkably
high from above downwards, and is very broad at top, becoming
extremely narrow distally. This latter feature is owing
to the peculiar shape of the pterygoids; which, when viewed
from behind, do not appear to reach the basioccipital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[ 87 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>basisphenoid</i> is so destroyed by crushing, that nothing
can be said of its shape or of its foramina. It was, however,
evidently very stout. The alisphenoid is large and smooth
and is not ridged; the <i>foramen ovale</i> is small, and is not produced
into an anterior notch. The suture between the alisphenoid
and the pro-otic are quite distinct, but the latter is so
firmly anchylosed to the quadrate that its limits are indeterminable.
None of the other periotic bones are visible.</p>

<p>The <i>quadrate</i> is very long and broad. In shape it resembles
the corresponding bone of the alligator, but is somewhat
broader. The lower surface is divided into two unequal
parts by a conspicuous ridge, which runs to within an inch of
the articular surface. This surface has a more decidedly
grooved or trochlear appearance than in the common crocodile;
but not to the same degree as in the specimen described
by Dr. Leidy. It is more like the Mississippi alligator in this
respect than any living species of which we have specimens.</p>

<p>The <i>pterygoids</i> are of peculiar shape; they are long,
slender, and pointed, and meeting the basioccipital on the
median line in front, they project downwards and backwards.
Their posterior border is very deeply emarginate, so that they
seem to have no connection with each other, or with the basioccipital;
instead of having the broad, plate-like appearance
of these bones in recent species. The suture between these
on the palatal surface is long; and the processes of the pterygoids,
which bound the posterior nares, are long and stout.
The posterior nares have the position which they take in the
recent species; they are visible in the occipital surface, and
are directed backwards as well as downwards. They are
rather small, and appear to have no septum between them,
but this cannot be said with any certainty.</p>

<p>The <i>transpalatine</i> is also somewhat peculiar in shape; the
process which joins the pterygoid is of great length, being
nearly as long as that bone. The other limbs are more normal
in length. The three processes are connected at the usual
angle.</p>

<p>The <i>palatals</i> are long and narrow, becoming wider anterior
to the foramina. The suture with the maxillaries is
rounded, and there are no forward processes as in the true
crocodiles; but at the same time, these bones are not of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[ 88 ]</a></span>
shape exhibited in the alligators. The palatal foramina are of
immense length; they are more than one third as long as the
entire bony palate. Their width is also considerable.</p>

<p>The <i>maxillaries</i> are long and very broad; the alveolar
border is of about the same shape as in the crocodile, but less
decidedly sinuous; and the posterior part passes in below the
alveolus of the lower jaw. The convexity of the upper surface
of the maxillaries is not so well marked as in the true
crocodiles. It is nearly as flat as in the alligator. The palatine
plates of the maxillaries are short, broad, and nearly flat,
arching slightly to form the alveolus, and perforated along
this border by rows of foramina.</p>

<p>The <i>premaxillaries</i> are very short; they curve strongly
outwards from the notch and enclose the large anterior narial
opening, which is distinctively crocodilian (as distinguished from
other genera) in shape. The muzzle ends quite sharply. The
palatine processes are short and convex in both directions, and
the incisive foramen is heart-shaped. The alveolus is quite
regular in outline; it is pitted in front for the first mandibular
teeth, but there is no perforation for them.</p>

<p>The teeth are short, stout, compressed so as to form cutting-edges,
and are somewhat obtuse. They are finely striated
from base to tip. The premaxillary held four teeth; these
are all broken off, but from their fangs it appears that they
formed an uninterrupted row, and were subequal in size. The
maxillary accommodated fifteen teeth, of which the fifth is
the largest, and forms a very prominent canine. The posterior
maxillary teeth are proportionately larger, and more equal
than in either crocodile or alligator.</p>

<p>The <i>nasals</i> are rather broad; they send processes into the
anterior narial opening, which tend to divide it, but this division
was probably not complete. The limits of the <i>prefrontals</i>
and <i>lachrymals</i> are so obscure as to preclude description.</p>

<p>The <i>frontals</i> are long and very narrow, though wider than
in the alligator. They are smooth and flat, exhibiting no concavity
on top. They expand considerably at the posterior
part of the orbit, at the sutures with the post-frontals. These
bones are long, stout, and curved very strongly outwards.</p>

<p>The <i>mastoids</i> are of remarkable size; they project far
backward along the tympanic, and encroach largely upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[ 89 ]</a></span>
occipital region. It is partly owing to this that the occiput
is so high.</p>

<p>The <i>parietals</i> are short, and very narrow between the temporal
orifices, behind these they expand considerably. The
orbits are large and of irregular shape.</p>

<p>The <i>malar</i> is long and rather slender.</p>

<p>The <i>mandible</i> is long, rather shallow, but very thick. The
symphysis is very long, extending as far as the seventh tooth.
The chin is quite sharp, but becomes broad, as the rami diverge
quite rapidly. The alveolar border is rounded and comparatively
straight, the median enlargement of the dentary is in
thickness rather than in height. The two rami diverge at an
angle which is more open than in the true crocodiles, and less
so than in the alligator. The mandibular foramen is smaller
than in the latter genus, but corresponds with it in position;
it has its long diameter parallel with, and not oblique
to, the alveolus. The mandibular fossa is extremely large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[ 90 ]</a></span>
and deep. The splenial is long and stout, ends obtusely, and
does not reach the symphysis. The articular cavity is broad
from side to side, but rather shallow; it is not divided into
two distinct facets as in the alligator. The post-glenoid
process is very stout; it projects but slightly upwards, less so
than in either crocodile or alligator. It has no median ridge
as in the former genus, and is tuberous at the end.</p>

<p>The teeth are much like those of the upper jaw, but are
somewhat sharper and more conical; they are not recurved,
and have no distinct constriction, as is found in most of the
recent species. There are about eighteen teeth to each
ramus; the first is large and sharp, and is followed by two small
ones and then by the canine. The remaining teeth do not
exhibit any great differences of size.</p>

<p><i>Cervicals.</i>&mdash;The centra are long and nearly cylindrical,
expanding slightly near the anterior face. The hypapophyses
are short and broad; they project forwards, and are somewhat
compressed. The vascular foramina correspond in size
and position to those of the alligator. The neural canal is
small and subcircular, having comparatively short but very
stout neurapophyses, which are perforated behind the diapophyses.
These are short and stout, and are developed

<p>The dermal scutes are long ellipses, deeply pitted on one
side, but without a trace of a keel. Their edges show no
signs of sutural union.</p>

<p>The bones described indicate a reptile about fifteen feet
long. They were found near Smith's Fork, Wyoming.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Crocodilus parvus</span>, <i>sp. nov.</i></p>

<p>A small reptile represented by sixteen vertebræ and a
portion of the pelvis.</p>

<p>The <i>cervicals</i> have short centra, with very deep articular
cups and hemispherical heads: the latter have a prominent
rim around the base. The hypapophyses are short, stout,
and very nearly vertical in direction; the sides of the centra
are channelled by a deep vertebraterial canal; the parapophyses
are developed very low down, and are very prominent.
The diapophyses are developed partly from the centra and
partly from the neurapophyses; they are stout and very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[ 92 ]</a></span>
short. The facets for the ribs are developed in the usual
place. The neural arch is rather high, and forms a small,
narrow canal; the proportions of the neurapophyses and
neural spines are about as in <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, but the
zygapophyses are not so prominent.</p>

<p>The <i>dorsals</i> show a considerable increase in size over the
cervicals; the centra become elongate, and the articular
cups shallower and transversely oval. Several of the anterior
vertebræ retain large hypapophyses. In the dorsal region
the diapophyses are developed from the neurapophyses alone,
and at a considerable height above the neuro-central suture;
they are long and depressed. The zygapophyses and neural
spines present no peculiarities of structure.</p>

<p>In the <i>lumbar</i> region the vertebræ regain their cylindrical
form, and become still more elongate; but the cups are
comparatively shallow and the heads low; there is no distinct
shoulder. The neural canal is small, with low, broad
neurapophyses, from which are developed very broad and
depressed diapophyses, which project outwards in a horizontal
plane. The neural spines are thick, and broad antero-posteriorly,
but are so broken that their height cannot be determined.</p>

<p>In both dorsal and lumbar region the neurapophyses are
deeply notched on their posterior edges, and close to the
neuro-central sutures, for the passage of the spinal nerves.</p>

<p>The <i>ilium</i> is very high compared with most crocodiles;
its vertical diameter is considerably more than half of the
antero-posterior diameter. The construction of the bone is
very much like that in the modern <i>Crocodilia</i>; but the suprailiac
border is more regular, and the anterior tuberosity is not so
thick or so much everted as in these forms. The acetabulum
is small, shallow, directed downwards and outwards, and
situated considerably forward of the median line. The iliac
surface is smooth, but very irregular, being very deeply concave
above the acetabulum, and convex behind it. The sacral
surface is rugose, rises above the sacrum, and shows attachments
for two sacral vertebræ. Thus the construction of the
entire pelvis shows but very little variation from the modern
type.</p>

pitting of the dermal scutes, and of all the cranial bones, is
deeper than in any other of the Bridger crocodilians in our
possession, and very strongly resembles that in <i>Alligator
mississippiensis</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>mandible</i> has a long symphysis, and the alveolar
border shows the sudden deep depression just behind it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[ 94 ]</a></span>

however, do not diverge at such an open angle. The jaw
is very stout, and is deeper and thinner than in <i>Crocodilus
Elliotii</i>; and is of about the same proportionate thickness, but
deeper than in the alligator. The splenial ends obtusely, and
approaches the symphysis somewhat more closely than in
the alligator, but does not enter into its formation. The
teeth are stout and obtusely conical, not striate, and implanted
very close together; they exhibit about the same
alternation of size as do those of the alligator. What appears
to be the canine is small; it is preceded by a much smaller,
and succeeded by a slightly smaller tooth. The dermal scutes
are quadrate in shape; they are deeply and irregularly pitted,
and have a low but distinct longitudinal keel; they are
suturally united by their lateral borders.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">CHELONIA.</p>

<p>The Bridger beds have yielded a great abundance and
variety of land, marsh, and fresh-water chelonians. They
present much variation of form and size; and, owing to the
great pressure in the strata, scarcely any two specimens of the
same species are alike; occasionally, however, an undistorted
specimen is obtained.</p>

<p>The most abundant remains of turtles are those of a species
of the recent genus <i>Emys</i>, which are found in all the
beds, and are, perhaps, the commonest fossils of the basin.
The genera <i>Trionyx</i> and <i>Hadrianus</i> (<i>Testudo</i>, Leidy) follow
next in order.</p>

<p>Represented by the right humerus of a large individual.</p>

<p>This bone is intermediate in character between the corresponding
bones of <i>Testudo</i> and <i>Emys</i>. The head is longer and
narrower than in the former genus; it is implanted on a short,
distinct neck, and is strongly convex in both directions. The
articular surface extends to the base of the internal tuberosity.
The tuberosities, especially the external one, are very large
and thick. The external rises above the head, and resembles
that of <i>Emys</i> in shape. The fossa separating the tuberosities
is comparatively narrow. The shaft is much like that of
<i>Emys</i>, but is somewhat more strongly curved; not so much,
however, as in <i>Testudo</i>, and the distal end is not so much flattened.
The anconeal fossa is wider and deeper than in either
genus. The trochlea is broad, and divided by an obscure
groove into a small and convex radial face, and a nearly
plane (transversely) ulnar face. The condyles are prominent
and rugose.</p>

<p>Represented by six perfect shells from Cottonwood and
Dry Creeks, and Henry's Fork, and a shoulder girdle from
Cottonwood Creek, which is provisionally referred to this
species.</p>

<p>This species, when adult, was upward of a foot in length,
and in the composition of the shell, number of scutes, etc.,
resembled the living species of the genus.</p>

<p><i>The Shoulder Girdle</i> has the form characteristic of the
<i>Emydidæ</i>, but presents some peculiarities. The scapula is
short, not being as long as the coracoid, and is not so straight or
cylindrical as is usual in <i>Emys</i>; but is compressed, and somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[ 96 ]</a></span>
recurved, and tapers towards the upper extremity, which
is marked by a smooth rounded facet for the cartilaginous
supra-scapula. The precoracoid is long, sub-cylindrical at its
origin, but becomes broad and flat distally; at the extremity it
is longitudinally striated. The proximal end is flexed forward
at an obtuse angle, and is expanded to form the long suture
with the scapula and coracoid. It contributes considerably
to the glenoid cavity. The coracoid is remarkably long, and
after leaving the sutures with the other elements of the girdle,
becomes very broad and thin. This is most marked distally.
The anterior border is thickened, and the bone is slightly
concave on both surfaces.</p>

<p>The three parts of the shoulder girdle are united by distinct
bony symphyses; they differ from some of the modern
species, in which there is only a ligamentous union between
the coracoid and the other parts. It presents a further difference
in the long and slender neck which is formed by the
flexing of the precoracoid, and in the shallow and subcircular
glenoid cavity. The short scapula and long coracoid would
indicate a species with a low, broad carapace, as was probably
the case in <i>E. wyomingensis</i>, though much difficulty has been
experienced in determining this point, owing to the distortion
of the specimens.</p>

<p>Having secured a very perfect specimen of this genus, we
are enabled to complete the definition of its generic characters.
We give, then, Professor Cope's definition, with some
emendations and additions: Dorsal and anal fins short;
ventral fin sometimes beneath and sometimes in advance of
the dorsal. The premaxillary forms all of the superior arcade
of the mouth, which has a wide gape, opening back behind
the orbit. This bone has a row of long, slender, recurved,
and subequal teeth implanted in it. The dentary is
stout, and has a few small teeth. The branchiostegal rays
are six in number, and are rather wide. The preoperculum
IS serrate. The operculum is ridged on top. The anterior
vertebræ are unmodified, and the centra are not elongate. A
strong acute spine supports the dorsal, and a similar one the
anal fin. There is a long post-clavicle, which may or may not
extend to the base of the ventral parallel with the femur.
The femur is long and furcate; the external part straight and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[ 98 ]</a></span>
reaching to the clavicle; the internal curves to meet the corresponding
portion of its fellow. The ventral radii are eight
in number, and the caudal fin is furcate. The scales are peculiar,
and characteristic of the genus. They are very thin,
and have borders fringed with long, close-set, bristle-like
processes. This genus includes as yet only three species:
<i>T. hians</i>, from Osivio, Nev.; and <i>T. foliarum</i> and <i>T. Copei</i>, from
Florissant, Col.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Tricophanes Copei</span>, <i>sp. nov.</i></p>

<p>Vertebræ D. 12, C. 18, Radii D. 14, A. 8, V. 8, C. 41, P.
5 only visible, not all preserved. The dorsal fin is long, and
projects beyond the beginning of the anal fin; the mouth is
terminal, and the muzzle rather sharp. All the bones of the
skeleton are very slender; and this is especially true of the
ribs, which are not as thick as the interneurals. The neural
and hæmal spines are short and slender. The origin of the
dorsal is nearer to the muzzle than to the caudal; though, as
a whole, the fin is on the hinder half of the body. There are
no interneural spines in front of the dorsal fin; those supporting
the fin are short, slender, and without the laminar
expansions found in <i>T. foliarum</i>. The caudal fin consists of
numerous jointed rays, which are supported by the neural
and hæmal spines of the last three vertebræ. The scales are
small, and exhibit the peculiarities of the genus, but the rows
are too imperfect to be counted.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Amia scutata</span>, Cope.</p>

<p class="tdc">Bull, of U. S. Geol. Survey, No. 1 of Series II, p</p>

<p>A species of about the size of <i>A. calva</i>, but with a proportionately
larger head. It is represented in our collection by
a specimen which lacks only a portion of the caudal and pectoral
fins. The <i>premaxillary</i> is short and stout, articulates
closely with the maxillary, and bears a single row of pointed
recurved teeth. These are shorter and straighter than in <i>A.
calva</i>. The <i>maxillary</i> is much as in the modern species, but is
rounder. The cranio-facial axis is straight and broad; the
<i>basioccipital</i> is the largest of the bones; the <i>basisphenoid</i> and
<i>presphenoid</i> are of the usual shape and size, but there is a
constriction at their junction which is not marked in the
modern species. The <i>vomer</i> is long and double, and at the
extremity is armed with rows of small teeth. The two portions
diverge more perceptibly than in <i>A. calva</i>, and are
stouter, though this appearance may, to some extent, be due
to flattening.</p>

<p>The <i>frontal</i> is long, broad, and thick; the upper surface is
delicately sculptured in a somewhat different pattern from
that seen in the modern species. The <i>parietal</i> is short and
broad, while the <i>epiotic</i> is unusually narrow. The <i>mandible</i> is
long and slender; the rami are incurved anteriorly, but apparently
not to the same extent as in <i>A. calva</i>. The articular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[ 103 ]</a></span>
has the shape of a long and narrow wedge; it does not form
a very close articulation with the dentary. The dentary is
long and comparatively slender, has a rounded outline, and is
occupied by an external row of large, and an internal band of
small teeth. The mandibular teeth, like those of the upper
jaw, are somewhat different from the teeth of <i>A. calva</i>; they
are shorter, stouter, and are not so much incurved or recurved.
They are very sharp, and show a constriction below the apex.
The small teeth are of the usual size and shape. The jugular
plate is well developed, and is long and narrow. The <i>hyoid
arch</i> is very much the same as that shown in the recent
species; the characteristic flat branchiostegals are well
marked; they appear to be thirteen in number.</p>

<p>The <i>scapular arch</i> is long and stout. The <i>clavicle</i> is
strongly bent, the supra-clavicle is short, and the <i>post-clavicle</i>
is long. The pectoral fin is too indistinct for description.</p>

<p>The <i>vertebræ</i> are of considerable depth in the anterior
dorsal region, and decrease steadily in size as they go backwards.
The neural spines are long and slender, and project
strongly backwards. The relation of the centra to the
arches seems to be about that seen in <i>A. calva</i>, but the neurapophyses
are more slender. The diapophyses are long and
slender, in this respect differing from the Bridger species and
approaching the modern one. The dorsals are thirty-five in
number. The caudals number about forty-seven. They
have smaller centra, but longer and stronger neurapophyses
than the dorsals. The hæmal arch is long, and the hæmapophyses
articulate movably with the centra. The spines
supporting the caudal fin rays are very stout. The dorsal fin
is long and soft, and has long interneurals supporting short
rays; these are fifty-three in number. The anal fin, on the
other hand, is very short, having but nine rays, which are long
and jointed, and articulate with short interhæmals. The caudal
fin appears to be of the usual form. The <i>femur</i> is of the
general shape characteristic of <i>Amia</i>, but is not just like that
of <i>A. calva</i>. It is shorter, broader at the proximal end, while
the distal end is narrower, and has a deeper constriction just
above it. The ventral fins are placed under the middle of the
dorsal region, and have each ten rays. The scales are of the
usual cycloidal shape, and minutely striate.</p>

<p>Represented by three vertebræ from the posterior part of
the dorsal region. The centra are subcircular and have deep
articular cones, with their bottoms above the centre, and
minutely perforate for the notochord. The centra are comparatively
quite long, and have prominent projecting rims,
and are truncate beneath. The facets for the neurapophyses
are long, and are separated into two parts for the contiguous
arches. The diapophyses are short and stout.</p>

<p>This species is represented by a single tooth from the
cretaceous sandstone near the Garden of the Gods, Col. It
does not agree exactly with any descriptions or plates which
we have seen; but the differences are probably owing to
the position or age of the specimen. The crown is low,
broad, and not very acute, the edge is finely serrate, and
there is no sensible difference between the serrations of the
two borders. The anterior border is undulating in outline,
but for the most part is convex; the posterior is short and
straight, and sends out quite a long heel. One face of the
crown is flat and the other is strongly convex. The root is
stout and divided into two fangs, which are longer and more
distinct than is common in this species. There are no denticles;
cementum smooth.</p>

<p>Although we have endeavored to make this catalogue as complete and
accurate as possible, we feel that errors and omissions are, from the nature of
the case, unavoidable. The material is so vast and heterogeneous, and is so
much scattered throughout numberless reports, bulletins, journals, and the
like, that its correct compilation is attended with great difficulties. However,
a beginning is here made which will render subsequent work easier. Owing
to the great number of discoveries which have since been made, Dr. Leidy's
excellent catalogue of 1871 covers now but a very small portion of the ground.</p>

<p>In this list we have made no attempt to decide disputed questions of
priority and synonymy. Doubtless, many of the genera and species here given
will be found to be synonyms of American or European forms; but at present
these questions cannot be settled. Where synonyms are given, they are the
determinations of the original describer indicated in subsequent publications</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
